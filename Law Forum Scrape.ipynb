This was part of one of the hackathon's topic areas, to explore how social media is used to help people deal with justice problems, particularly employment justice problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three aims to this short piece of analysis:\n",
    "* Demonstrate how social media analysis can be used to help understand people's approaches to solving justice problems\n",
    "* Explore where the prevalence of discussions around employment justice problems lie on lawforum.com\n",
    "* See what sort of discussions take place about employment justice problems on lawforum.com\n",

    "This can be used as a framework when webscraping other forums for analysing how social media is used to solve justice problems.\n",

There is a further proviso which is that the information about the  further pension must have come to you recently A delay in making your application to set aside or appeal against the order can be fatal. Your application must be made promptly, ie as soon as you become aware of the facts. Certainly it must be done inside a year. There have been cases of material non-disclosure which have been proved, but the applicant failed to set aside the order because they had waited too long after they became aware of the new facts, before doing anything about it. Without knowing more, I can only hazard an educated guess as to what might be the outcome of a successful challenge; my educated guess is that it is likely that it would be split in the same proportion as your ex husband's other pension was split, at least unless a significant part was accrued prior to marriage It may be that an initial solicitors' letter will be sufficient to prompt your ex into offering a compromise if you have been involved in such expensive proceedings in the recent past I'm not in a position to recommend any particular firm of solicitors, you could take a look at the Legal 500 website and see who are the recommended solicitors for family law in your area/ \\n\",\n",

I have just received an email from the respondent's solicitors asking the tribunal judge for a 2 week extension. The solicitor's reasons are that they have only had the case for a couple of days and it is complex. They also say that the respondent was waiting for an internal process to complete, however the internal process completed 3 weeks before the claim was put to them.I don't want to object to the extension and seem unreasonable. However I feel that claiming that it was due to the internal procedure which was 5 weeks before this request is unreasonable. Surely the solicitor only receiving the claim 1 week before the response date is the responsibility of the respondent.? They also say that they need the extension because the main respondent is on holiday and they can't get the information needed.I want to seem reasonable, but I also want the judge to have the full picture as the nature of the case has been available to them through the whole conciliation process, which they chose not to engage in. To say it is complex at this point should not be a surprise.Is there any way I can convey my views (I am self representing) to the judge without appearing unwilling to ensure due process is followed.I feel strongly that I should not be put out by this as I have a serious mental health problem which deteriorates at this time of year, which will limit my capacity to carry on with the process. I also have family responsibilities (mum knee replacement) and personal deadlines to meet during the new date requested. It will disadvantage me.Can anyone advise me, please?Thanks\",\n",

The email, which I was not expecting, as it's a new process, went to my Spam folder, and I only noticed it after a deadline they gave me had passed.  I'm being charged a late fee as a consequence.  Does anyone happen to know if sending such an email, requesting money, without any safeguard to ensure it is delivered and read in a timely manner is legitimately legal?  I would have though that at the very least a delivery/read receipt would be required given the financial implications, and steps to send reminder emails or communicate via other means e.g. post, if no acknowledgement/response is received are required.  Does anyone happen to know the rules around this please?  Many thanks. \",\n",

Once in the takeaway there was a man on his own and a couple. The man took a dislike to my disabled friend (tracheotomy) and they began to argue. The woman from the couple began to say she was going to hit my friend which I asked her to just sit down and leave it. I tried to calm the situation but everything happened so fast.The man and my disabled friend began fighting and then the woman (who didn't know the man) came over and began to hit and my pull my friends hair while her husband was punching her to the back of the head. I pulled away the woman and punched her several times while her husband was also punching me in the head. While this happened the original man who caused the argument began to seriously assault my friend to which her partner ended up fighting with him to stop it.I went back to the woman apologised and asked to shake hands they swore at me and threw me into the window so I went outside. Once the pizza shop door was closed she began coming to the window goulding me and then my friend saying she was going to kill us and taking the mick out of her tracheotomy and calling me fat we did argue back. We then left in a taxi.The lady from the taxi place next door rang the police and cctv has been taken. I don't know if this is protocol or she is getting me done for it. She does have marks. Since this she has posted an image of me over social media to be shared and that she did nothing wrong and I attacked her. I am not that sort of person and I'm worried. I was defending my friend from both a man and a woman they could have killed her if they knocked out her tracheotomy. I don't think any person would stand there and let there friend get beat up.Now however they keep trying to see my social media page this is going around I haven't responded to any. She also has a lot of family that live close by who are notorious for fighting brutally in groups. I am scared I live with my three little boys alone and I'm worried they are going to turn up. I am worried I will be arrested and charged which I have never been arrested in my life and worried about what the outcome will be of the post. It has been reported but it hasn't been removed.Would I have a leg to stand on with it been defence to others? How long will it be before the police come to arrest me? And would anyone else be charged? What can I do about the posts and the people that will now be after me?I am genuinely sorry about the lady's face but it didn't mean to get that far I just wanted her off my friend. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Thank you :(\",\n",

Today I have been at the end of my tether as it was frowned up when I asked for someone to cover my group whilst I went to the shops (using my car, as I was unable to go tonight due to commitments with my son) to obtain cooking ingredients for an activity that they have scheduled for tomorrowIm pretty sure I have read somewhere that employees are entitled to go to work & have all materials, tools etc etc to be able to complete their job, in my eyes being forced to go shopping in your own time to get supplies for things the club has scheduled is not adhereing to this! I wouldn\\'t mind if it was now & again but last week i got a text off a manager to say I have 35 kids in my group the following day & i would need ingredients as they had planned some cookery thing, at the time I was in the cinema with my son & daughter to celebrate his birthday with 6 other kids!!

Honey also has high capability to resistbacteria that evolved their immune systems against standard medications.Honey, in the old and modern era, has always been used as a natural medicine for many diseases. This new study might be a new twist to use honey for medical purposes.According to the study that has been done through Sidney University in Australia, Dekarter, a scientific teacher in the biological and microbial science college says, \"our research has shown that honey can replace many of the antibiotics that are used to treat cuts such as ointments and different creams. Also, using honey for healing purposes will increase the aging period of antibiotics. \"She also adds:\" most of the bacteria that cause infections in hospitals are at least resistance to one type of antibiotic, which means the need to produce new and stronger antibiotics that are able to execute bacteria that cause diseases. \"Honey is a complicated compound that is consists of 800 molecules. This complication makes it difficult for scientists to fully understand the honey\\'s mechanism of resisting and killing the bacteria. scientist Dekarter says: \"until now, we have not found the method the honey apply to resist bacteria, but most likely there is the molecule\" Methylglyoxal \", which is part of the honey, that reacts with other molecules which we have not discovered yet , to become able to inhibit bacteria from multiplying and making new generations that have the ability to resist to antibiotics. \"Doctor Rose Koper, from the Health Science college of Wells University, has conducted a research regarding honey\\'s activity against bacteria, and she wrote the book \"Honey facing cuts\". In her book, she says: \"there are many factors that give honey the special healing characteristics, including high sugar level, low water level, and low acidity.\"Honey is a healing for peopleMy beloved for the sake of Allah! These new studies that are discovered by scientists and amaze them are not as surprising for us, because Allah Almighty has mentioned honey in his book, and revealed a chapter and call it \"An-Nahl\" which mean Bees. Allah almighty says: \"And your Lord inspired the bee, saying:\" Take you habitations in the mountains and in the trees and in what they erect * Then, eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of your Lord made easy (for you \"winking smiley. There comes forth from their bellies, a drink of varying color wherein is healing for men. Verily, in this is indeed a sign for people who think \"[An-Nahl 68-69].In conclusion, we advise every sister and brother to always have honey available in their homes. Honey is useful for treating burns, cuts, pyorrhea and it, is good for skin, cold and virus infections.

Her house automatically passed over to my Sister as a joint tenancy agreement had been made in 2008 without my knowledge. I have subsequently obtained a copy and it looks like it was drawn up and witnessed by a Solicitor. Unfortunately this secret caused some friction in our Brother/Sister relationship and since my Mother's death, my Sister had steadfastly refused to agree to make application for Letters of Administration (she realises that I require timely resolution as my daughter is off to University in September). Whilst I appreciate that if I obtained a copy of her Death Certificate I could probably apply myself, as I have absolutely no knowledge of what Bank Accounts, Insurance and funeral policies and assets she had, it is difficult for me to proceed if my Sister refuses to cooperate as she has all of the information to hand in her house. As the assets are unlikely to amount to much I suspect that involving a solicitor would effectively wipe out any assets. Has anyone any ideas on what other options are available to me? Not sure that if I all Banks near to where my Mother lived enclosing a Death Certificate and my Birth Certificate in order to report her death in case she banked with them, would they be obliged to respond so that I could use the information in order to apply for probate?\",\n",

You can easily estimate the house valuye and divide by two. Once probate is obtained you can then write/speak to your sister and explain that as administrator you have the right to all the papers.

       " {'1.Init_Post': u'hi, I wonder if anyone can help? I am self employed and work as a GP locum. One of the NHS areas in which I work has decided to make all of their locums \"employed\" to avoid issues with the taxman. When I take up a locum job, I agree a fee with the practice in question. I then am paid gross, and pay tax etc via self assessment.With the switch the employee status, I am now paid via PAYE. However the employer has deducted tax and both employers and employees NI. Their explanation....that I am paid a contracted rate and they need to make all of the necessary deductions from this, and I get whats left. So they have taken off \\xa3300 to pay employers NI.We were told about this change by a practice manager in March. I never received any official letter re this, although the practice manager got one, and has now passed it to me. I therefore didn\\'t agree to the changes, or the deduction, and certainly didn\\'t sign anything. The letter says \"we need to deduct employment tax and NI\" not specifying which.I also did the work at the end of March and the payment was made in May, so the work was done under the old rules and the payment made under the new rules, but again it did say in the letter I didn\\'t see until today, that all payments made after April would be made under the new system \"regardless of when the work was done\". Can they do this? Again bearing in mind I didn\\'t agree to this.SOrry it\\'s confusing!thanks',\n",

In section entitled Pecuniary Legacies I was given 25,000 pounds and this was reduced in the codicle to 10,000. Probate was granted to Nat West as the executor \"with a codicil\", implying to me that there was only one codicil.This astonished me as I did not receive this gift, nor was I aware of it until now.I am resident in Vancouver Canada and am wondering how I proceed?Thanks in anticipation.',\n",

My question is can I be dismissed for a single comment, said out of work hours at a private function with no connection to the company I work for, as in I was not wearing company branded clothing. The person I said it to has accepted my apology it's others that heard it that I'm concerned about and what they can do.Any help is appreciated.\",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"In September 2004 my boss was being investigated for fraud and was eventually sent to prison. I got my colleague to remove all client's work, files and computer work from his offices. I made him co-director of our joint limited company to make him feel he had got a stake in this business. The client's work was way behind and piling up. My co-director got a friend of his in to help bring tax returns right up to date and the pair of them soon got all work up to date while I sat back and did nothing. My boss had taken \\xa330,000 plus in advance fees off clients so in the first 7 months we paid expenses and freelance fees and nothing for ourselves. Then when work was being done on time by my hard-working co-director I took the opportunity to put my mobile calls and motor expenses, for this business and my other businesses, through this one business as well as taking \\xa31,500 per month whilst I paid my co-director \\xa31,250 per month for his wages and all the office expenses. I was lapping it up, he did all the work and I sat back and lived a easy luxurious life; it was easy because I had found a mug. Then 8 months down the line he came out with an humginger, that we should both stop drawing from the business to make the Balance Sheet stronger; while he took nothing for three months I took my \\xa31,500 and his \\xa31,250 per month and he didn't know about it because I had sole control over the bank account. After he noticed this, whilst doing our VAT, he then asked for \\xa31,500 for himself but I only paid him \\xa31,250 and he accepted it; I was on a winner and it was a pleasure to see him and his new wife struggling financially to make ends meet. In 2007 he said he wanted to sell up the business and his house to move elsewhere but I just hoped he would forget about it for the status quo to remain. In September 2007 he told me he had had talks to sell our business without my knowledge and I felt that I had my trust in him shattered but we moved on. Eventually I reluctantly offered to buy his share for \\xa325,000 being \\xa315,000 down,\\xa35,000 3 months later and \\xa35,000 a year later. After our partnership had ended I got him to do work for me to keep the hand over smooth before the new mug came in. I paid him for the first month but then noticed irregularities so when I paid him these wages and second instalment I immediately put a stop on both cheques and put the matter in police hands. He had taken \\xa315,000 out of our limited company prior to signing the contract and that was going to be the money I was going to use for the first instalment. After this the second mug worked for me for about 6 months but then just phoned me to say he had won the national lottery so I attempted to keep the work up to date myself even though I had no idea what I was doing. Then in 2009 another mug accountant came along and I made him co-director and I then was back to my same old ways again watching him do all the work whilst I sat back to enjoy the benefits, he left in 2012 and unfortunately he sued me and I had to pay him out and he then had the audacity to take some of my clients with him. My first co-director was then charged in September 2011, in Crown Court, with fraud and I was hoping to see him go to prison. I had already had him struck off as a chartered accountant and I was hoping that he would die in prison or in poverty when he came out. Somehow he managed to bend the rules to get off with a suspended and the fraudster only paid me back \\xa310,000 and I don't no how he got away with that because I wanted \\xa325,000 off him. In January 2014 he then took me to court for the two instalments of \\xa35,000 each plus a VAT bill he said he had paid, I took with me the Detective Sergeant in the fraud case as my legal representative and it ended up in deadlock. I then employed a solicitor to defend my case because I only felt it right that he should pay me more money, unfortunately I ended up with a \\xa310,000 solicitors bill and had to pay the mug \\xa35,000. In March 2014 when I paid him the \\xa35,000 I found out his wife had died suddenly, well that was poetic justice. I have since been trying to get my ex co-director done for harassment, by the police, for contacting my clients in attempt to get them back; don't no how he dares and I just hope that he dies in poverty. By the way I haven't told you that I am a Roman Catholic and have been brought up since I was a boy as a Christian. I still live a christian life but business comes outside of that and it doesn't concern God what I do in that respect.\",\n",

We were going there because I had an appointment with a client because, believe or not, I am not one of those types who relies on benefits and by rights my wife should be on DLA and Mobility. We were then going up to Scarborough for a few days break as I have had a very hard year doing client's work to earn money to have our house converted into flats to give us another income and doing a lot of work on that as well and my working week as usually been in excess of 60 hours so lack of concentration, due to tiredness, will have had an effect on my car's speed. I had already made three errors prior to that; I came off M1 onto M18 by mistake and then missed turn off for M62 off A1 and then turned off at wrong place to go to my client's premises all because I am no longer used to travelling to big cities any more. I know that I should at the age of 64 pack it all in and rely on the benefits I already mentioned but what a country this would be if we all did that. So no I couldn't put off the journey because I have no other way of earning a living. Think I will have to accept the probable points but the fines are different now aren't they; they are now based on 10% of your income and if that is annual income I will probably have a fine of \\xa31,800 to pay so I will need to go onto benefits to pay that sort of sum due to the large debts the police and courts have already imposed on me.\",\n",

Through this they worked out I was under 18 when I created the account, and as such they are saying they will permanently limit (essentially closing) my account. I spoke to one of their people on the phone yesterday that told me \"I have manually moved the money from your PayPal account into your bank account ending in ****. This will take 72 hours though I will put in a special request for this to be done sooner\".  I phoned up again this morning to check if indeed payment would take place prior to the usual 72 hour point. At this point I was told that the gentleman that had made the promise was wrong, and he had no power to do this.  PayPal are now saying they will be keeping my money for 180 days, for buyer protection. I\\'m 19, I run my own business (though this is all a personal matter) so \\xa3800+ is a LOT of money to me. I\\'d like to know, as I was 17 when I made the account, are their terms and conditions which I \\'signed\\' whilst a minor, now relevant to me? Secondly, with regards to the phone call yesterday in which I was told the funds had been moved across (and would take 72 hours to show in my bank account), does this amount to a contract (because I certainly ended the call confident I would have the money in my bank account in a few days\\' time).And as a bit of a side note, can they really keep the money for 180 days? and will they have to pay interest on the amount.

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u\"Thankyou for the replies and sorry for the long delay in replying. I will try and explain this better as i know it was a bit vague. It all began when my dad was taken ill (mental illness).He owned a farm and i had run the farm for 30 years as my own and always expected that it would be mine. I spent a fortune on the everyday maintainance and putting buildings etc on the farm. However, my sister who kept 2 horses at the farm became very friendly with my dad to the point where he spoke to nearly no one else, they stood outside her stables everyday and i could hear them making degrading remarks and poking fun at my mum and  and it got to the point where he turned against my mum and i know my sister was the one manipulating him, she took control of all his day to day finances which my mother had taken care of for 50 years, he was even convinced my mum was poisoning him. Anyhow, when he became ill we approached my sister as we had a fair idea she knew what was in his will, she said he had left one farm to her and one to me. For months after this her and i discussed this at length and she told me that i had nothing to worry about that i had farmed the land and that i would get what ever was left to her, all she wanted was her stables, paddock and grazing rights for four horses. Infact there was a family meeting at another of my sisters houses one night and she went round and asked all of my other syblings if they inherited any land would they be prepared to give it to me as she would be giving anything she inherited to me and that i should get the land as i had looked after and invested in the land for the past 30 years. Any how after my dad died and the will was read it turned out that he had left one farm to her util her 70th year and then it went to her son and one farm to me until my 70th year and it then also went to her son.Now the farm he had left to her was in his name only but the farm he left to me was in joint names with my mum which meant the farm went to her by survivorship and she kindly transfered it to me. So i had a decision to make as to whether to challenge the will or not so i met with my sister who i should point out i was on very good terms with and trusted totally. Anyway she told me that i had nothing to worry about, all she wanted  was her stables etc and that i would be taken care of that they would do the right thing. I then met with her and her son and we decided what i was to get but by this time things had changed and they now were keeping a large chunk of land and more buildings. The problem i had was that the boundaries between the two farms fell through the middle of the buildings i use for my main enterprise but they said there was no problem it would all be sorted. So this sister and another sister of mine were the executors of dads will and they went to the solicitors to sort out the details. My sister who had inherited the farm told my other sister not to worry about the boundaries and that the land should be changed exactly as the will stated and that she would sort it out when she was giving me the piece of land that i required from her. Some months later nothing she had transfered nothing to me and i approached her and her son to ask what was happening and they announced that they could do nothing for at least 6 years as they wanted to pass a building site and they needed to keep all the buildings etc to help with planning permission. I said that that would'nt be any good as i had to make a significant investment in my business and that i need the buildings as security for the loans. so they went off and spoke to their architect who said that it should'nt be a problem and they agreed to transfer me what i required. So i went ahead and approached the bank and they agreed to lend me the money and this portion of land was to be part of the security. So more months passed and still nothing happened and i approached them again but everytime we got near an agreement they moved the goal post and would never sign until i did something more or gave something else up. The last thing was she said she wouldnt sign until we had our own electrical supply installed. Now we had agreed that i would bring a cable through their land to get my supply which would have cost about \\xa31500 but they then said under no circumstance would that be happening and i had to bring it a much longer distance at a cost of 8k but even after this she still would not sign. Now they want to take more land out of the agreement plus buildings but all this is part of what i am relying on as security against my borrowings and my bank are now asking why this has not all been sorted. Sorry for the long post but I'm just at a loss what to do, Buildings that I put up in recent years at a cost of 100k still sit on there land as well and they refuse to honour what we agreed.\",\n",

The builder has been paid a large sum and the Structural engineer has condemned the work he has done to date, and he has left our garage covered in asbestos pieces and asbestos dust. He is now trying to end the contract.However, we initially approached the builder though an Architect (lets say John Smith Architects Ltd) as they had great reviews for building work as they provide a construction service. The quote came from their email address and has there email address on it. There website also states they offer a full construction service. The quote was agreed and a contract signed with the equivalent of John Smith Construction Ltd. So it was our understanding that they were one of the same. They also shared the same business address.We were then contacted by the Architect last week (as things were starting to go wrong) saying that they had disassociated themselves with JS Construction. I am currently keeping them included on any correspondece with the builder but they are saying they have nothing to do with it as contract was signed by JS Construction. This does not appear fair to me since it was them who we originally contacted and offered to provided a price, them who provided a price (using their email address) - are they also contractually liable?It now get's worse as John Smith Construction Ltd don't actually exist under companies house but are listed as JSC Construction Ltd - however I assume the contract is still valid as it was acted upon?Lastly, we have also found out that the builder has used a name which isn't his real name when setting up the company (for example his real name is John Smithson but has set up the company as John Smithh). If you search his real name you get a number of articles saying he is a cowboy builder and has left lots of people with shoddy work and out of pocket.

He also offered me the chance to sign any interest over to his children without any money being exchanged.I asked a solicitor for advice and he wrote a letter to my brother explaining that any offer would have to be in accordance with the deed of trust, not an amount which was substantially less or without any consideration at all.Needless to say that was the last time I heard from my brother.My question is, would there be any way that the land registry could lodge a note that I have an interest/deed of trust outstanding in the property so that they would notify me when it is sold, or so that the buyer would know that I have an outstanding interest in the property?i am not sure that there is much I can do about him letting the property and not paying me a share of the rent, but I would like to think I would get some inheritance when it is sold.Many thanks',\n",

An application can only be issued after a MIAM or an exemption. Assuming the application has been issued there's no further obligation to attend MIAM during the same proceedings. So from that angle it doesn't matter how long she tries to delay. If the exchange of  financial information is the one that sometime is requested (informally) in mediation then no need to panic. Ask the mediator to go ahead - and if your wife doesn't turn up then ask the mediator to sign the certificate to that effect. You then have four months to issue the Form A. She'll find it difficult to hide assets. Upon the issue of an application - the court will instruct the parties to exchange Form E ( details) on the same day. If one party fails that would be a breach of a direction and could lead to court sanctions and ultimately to imprisonment if it continues. Is there a privately owned matrimonial home and if so is it in joint or sole name ? This may affect the issue around the decree absolute.  \",\n",

I received the original request over 12 weeks ago, followed two weeks later by an abrupt letter from her solicitor requesting I expidite their request for all my financial information a.s.a.p.. I replied that I was waiting for my annual statement from my bank so that I could provide them with up to date information. I received the statement later that week and wrote to her solicitor saying I had the information required but would not forward it until I was accorded the same information about her finances. I then waited four weeks with no reply, after which I again wrote to her solicitor asking what the hold up was as I had already told them the information requested was waiting. They replied two weeks later saying she had refused to give any financial details and they were awaiting instructions from her as to how they should proceed. That is how we stand now, over 12 weeks on. With regard to property, we have a jointly owned home valued at \\xa3220,000 and she owns two thirds of her mother's home with a value of approximately \\xa3240,000 which she has already said will not be involved in the financial settlement or mediation.

There is in fact no need for mediation as such - its just you've got to consider it and demonstrate it - usually by going to the first appointment. You can withdraw after that. What's involved in the financial settlement is a matter for a judge if it goes to court.  The main questions are needs, assets, and what assets were acquired during the marriage. So assuming you want to get a financial settlement: apply for mediation- if she declines to attend the mediator will sign the relevant part of form A. You then have four months to submit the form. The court will order both parties to complete Form E. You exchange at the same time. if no agreement off to court.\",\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u'On speaking to the case Lawyer at the CACD i was informed that the papers lodged with the grounds of appeal were too voluminous. I reduced the paper work to \"Admissions\" in accordance with section 10 of the criminal justice Act of 1967. The Registrar invited the Crown to comment. The Crown didnot agree with any of the 63 paragraphed Admissions. Yesterday I was at the CACD to observe proceedings. Before Lady Justice Hale was a Directions hearing involving Max Clifford. This hearing before Lady Justice Hale was a preparatory hearing for a renewed permission to appeal before the full court. On my issue I will like such a hearing as that before Lady Justice Hale to establish my Admissions as conclusive facts and also to get an order of disclosure against the crown before the proceedings at the full court. Hence my question posted on the forum',\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u'I haven\\'t a clue what you are talking about - and I doubt if you have either. There are three ways of getting leave to appeal. Trial judge. Single judge ( not the trial judge) By direct application if either of the above two fail. Presumably as a its the CACD you\\'ve been convicted - so the facts are established. So why should CPS need to admit anything.  In any event S10 is for admissions by a party.  There is no obligation on the other party to accept it. If you want to serve evidence it should have been done under S9. However why it should be necessary is a mystery. If its evidence that was used at the trial - the court will have it anyway. If its \"new\"- you have to get permission to introduce it and show you did not and could not reasonably have obtained it for the trial.  ',\n",

The Admissions are statements from precendent cases, statements from CPS Respondents Notices, statements from trial transcripts and statements from section 9 witness statements. But the CPS did not agree to it. If a person gets convicted of an offence there are facts that establish the conviction and consequential sentence. These are the some of the contents of the Admissions that has not been agreed. You don't expect the CPS not to agree verbatims of their respondents notice but thats the situation. On the disclosure part the CPS carried out an investigation post trial. Gave a conclusion. I requested a witness statement from the  CPS on the investigator in order to understand how the concusion was arrived at. The CPS state it will not disclose any information bar the conclusion of the investigator. There are lots of trial transcripts, public documents, witnes statements and  judgments that created the volume of papers in the permission to appeal hence my question.  \\n\",\n",

As happens far too often the police are talking nonsense if that is what they have said. Even by the currently lamentable standards that prevail this is pretty grim. Harassment cannot occur if the behaviour is reasonable so he should have no fear if the communication came from the mediator or subsequently from service of court papers. Mediation is a requirement of issuing a C100 application (subject to statutory exceptions) so your son is perfectly entitled to proceed. If the ex partner refuses he will be able to get a certificate from the mediator to say that he attended and she refused. This will enable him to make his application. Read Section 14 on the C100 form - you will see there is a box for the mediator to tick where the applicant only attends.  ',\n",

The police have now spoken to his ex and she as openingly admitted to the police officer who spoke to her that she did not see my son throw stones at her home.(this according to police officers who spoke to my son was the basis of the PIN)  My son and I strongly beleive that the allegation made was vexaious and simply made to cause great distress to my son, The police keep informing my son it is a civil matter which this is what i beleive to be true in relation to care and parental responsibility of his son but not the reporting of the voilent act carried by his ex against my son. Is their any action or request we can put to the police to have this PIN revoked following his ex admitting to the police officer she did not see him , my son thinks his ex is attempting to create a senarior which makes my son out to be a bully and a thug and it appears she is abusing her position as a special constable by involving the police so it will create more distress to my son and to try and collate fabricated evidence of my sons character when he attends to court ensure his own sons right and enforced if she refuses mediation. Can you confirm any complaint of violence as to be looked at seriously by the police. they do appear to take his ex partner complaints seriuosly and act upon them but his complaint as just being brushed aside and he as being told she could put a counter allegation again if he wanted to carry on. I have thought to write a letter to the chief inspector of her area and ask if they would look into it.would this be effective or a waste of time. My son does not like to contact the police but he is in fear of a further alleagation being made by his ex so he could possiblily lose his job and income so he cannot fight for his son through the courts etc. The situation does seem to of escalated since he as refused to pay money to her father and his ex partner, she as informed him pay up or do not see your son, I must point out that they both agreed for my son to meet any needs as and when it is required and he would be more than happy to let someone independant decide on the level of funding he would need to pay once equal parental responsibility is agreed. any advice again greatly appreciated sorry for any grammer mistakes.',\n",

Your son cannot justifiably refuse child support because he is not seeing the child any more than the mother can refuse contact because he is not paying. Children should not be used as bargaining chips. So far as the PIN this is something he should complain about. The police are not supposed to issue these notices until they have given the person concerned the chance to give their side. Sadly this requirement is often ignored. He should complain using the IPCC website - there is no point in claiming he is being treated unfairly if he is notpreapred to use the available means to put matters right.',\n",

Thank you once again for your reply, I agree with you regards the child being used as a bargaining chip it should never be done,Unfortunately my son does not live with me or his mum, but had to find accommodation in the same area as his work so he can still earn money to pay towards his sons needs even though very little at the this time he is trying and bought his son new clothing and gave her some money for food etc, he just does not have the funds the mother is demanding at the moment, he as to house himself and pay the obvious bills which go along with renting a residence which is leaving him with very little money to feed himself at the moment, he as requested extra shifts to try and get extra income but he is already driving himself into the ground to make ends meet. he did make an agreement verbally with his ex to pay for anything his son requires she only as to let him know , not the best arrangement we know but he had two choices find somewhere to live locally or quit his job and he was not prepared to let his son go without. he as had to borrow from people who will need paying back so he could continue in his work. just a very differcult situation for him made worse by police refusing to revoke or take his complaint regarding the issueing of the PIN. His ex knows if he loses his job he cannot pay for court he will struggle etc. hence her demanding high amounts of money each week and using the child just to upset and stress him out.

Hi Kev. thank you for your txt message, I must admit I was hoping my father was incorrect , Unfortunately this is not the case as you and Dani appear to being using my son as a bargaining chip and using him to cause great distress and upset to me and indeed him to. The delay last monday was unforseen and out of my control, yet you and your daughter still break prior agreements made, As a father all i can do is appeal to your maternal instincts and ask you again to allow my father to collect Noah from Dani tomorrow at 9:30 am and will return him as normal just after tea, this will leave Dani free to collect Ethan from school as that is the agreement in place, I was informed by my father that during a telephone conversation you agreed that it would be best all concerned that we find a amicable solution , and preventing Noah from seeing his father is not amecable or this is doing is in my eyes adding fuel to the fire. But more importantly it is taking your frustrations out on my child.I will follow the police advice as instructed if my father cannot pick up noah at 9.30 tomorrow morning, and if you wish to terminate the prior agreements that are in place between me seeing noah, then any agreements between me you and Danielle will be nil and void, I am more than happy to let the independant governing body deal with the child access aspect of this dreadful situation you and Dani insist upon following through.I am no longer playing your childish game. to me it is quite simple we have to be adults and be respectful to each other as i am , skull duggery and childishness will not hold any weight when we do finally mediate. So i will respectfully ask you once again can you please ask Dani to allow my father to collect Noah tomorrow at 9.30 am! END of txt message. Is there anything we can do to see our grandson and he is son,his ex and her father they are just creating problem after problem when all my son requires is he have access to his son but more importantly his son as access to him if only for 1 day. We suspect she will ask to have mediation after the xmas break and then not urn up so as to delay the procedings. all the police keep saying is it is a civil matter and keep refusing to log his assault fromm his ex partner.

He was advised this by a family law solicitor because of the appalling way she is being un-cooperative and unreasonable and just putting allegation to the police to stop him seeing his son and it has worked for the time being.

So the application is straightforward enough. The likely outcome is your son will be given PR. He will also almost certainly get some contact. He is highly unlikely at this stage to get a child arrangements order- residency (i.e. the child to live with him).

My Son attending his first hearing with regards his son on the 10/02/2016 and he and his partner were instructed by the court official that no third parties are to be present over the next 8 weeks when the child is handed over and only my son and his ex be present at each hand over, and for the first 4 weeks no other family members of the father should be allowed to see his son so to encourage them bonding again. first week his partner turns up with her brother at the hand over. second week everything goes as instructed. third week partner does not turn up and her father turns up and hands over the child but not before becoming abrupt and agressive to wards my son. son asks why his daugther as not handed over and was informed she is at work inbetween insults etc. Son tries to contact solicitor (Bank holiday no reply) so speaks to police and asks for advice regarding the court order He was informed by the police if he was instructed by the court to hand the child back to only the mother (court instructions with no third parties as above)then that is what he should do otherwise he would be breaching the court order.So he contacted his ex explaining what the police had told him and informed her he woulk attend as usual time for the hand over after the visit but if she failed to turn up he would not hand over the child to anyone other then her as per the court orders.  come 130 pm her father turned up again with no sign of the mother and my son informed him of the situation and refused to hand him over, he contacted the mother again and she text him stating she woulk collect him after work 330 pm some two hours later then the court order. my son contacted his solicitor today has his ex partner informed him she had arrange with his solicitor for her father to drop of and collect because she had not received a reply or objection. she went ahead and broke the court orders. My son was not telephoned by his solcitor but did receive and email which i had to check as his telephone was not allowing him access to email so he was unaware of the request from either his solicitor or his ex partner. and if he had received the request he would of not of change the court order as it was set because they could not come to an agreement in relation to the child and was happy to see the 8 weeks as instructed by the court. My son is livid that his own solicitor failed to contact him when he was fully aware of the threatening behaviour of his partners father in the past. my son would not agree to changing a court order without first finding out why it should be done ( if she was ill or it was impossible for her to attend etc then obviously some other arrangement would of had to be made) this was not the case she was fully aware of the the court order and what day the child had to be handed over by her she was there with her own solcictor who insisted that no third parties be present at the hand over and the court agreed to it. Am i correct in thinking that any court order in relational to child access cannot be change without first contacting the court and should a solicitor be able to amend the order on behalf of his client to suit the needs of the respondant. i personally think he should seek an alternative solcictor as he failed to get any confirmation from my son and in my eyes he should of informed his partner he has not had a response from my son and the court order should be followed.. apologise for the rant but if we have to result to the courts for guidance and directions surely they should be followed otherwise what is the point of gong to court. My son feels she just does as she pleases because it suit her needs or wishes and based upon her conduct upto now i agree. if you could kindly advise appreciated.  ',\n",

(oldest child to former partner) the mother initially refused by saying the biological father would not allow my son to have contact with him as it would impede his own contact agreement etc. (3-5 days per week this is what the agreement was with her former partner when my son lived with the mum and the two children) today attended court hoping to have contact increased by another day and overnight and the mum as now informed the court and my son he cannot have more contact as she believes it is not in my grandsons best interest and it would split the brothers up so refused outright and the court have issued a warning to both my son and his partner that they must try and come to some agreement as now the dispute will go to trial she will not allow, she further said that the previous father of the elder brother no longers as him more the two days aweek (weekends) and if my grandson was to spend more time with his father it is not possible as it will split them up. a fair comment if it is true. Can my son apply to court to have contact with the elder brother of his son so he may have both children stay with him to, he did live with the elder son from being 22 months old prior to his getting pregnant with my grandson so the elder son is well familiar his brothers father (my son) He was brought up and cared for by my son jointly with his mum for more then 3 years until they split up. I would like to know if my son applied to the court to add the elder brother to the current child application would the court allow it. and if so how would we go about it and would it stop the current pending trail. I think she may be telling untruths to stop my grandson having more contact with his father and using her eldest son as the bargaining chip so to speak to prevent further contact by using something within the childrens act. I would assume that if we were allowed to put the application in the eldest childs father would have to agree or at the very least confirm what days he does infact have his own child thus confirming or denying what my sons ex partner said in court is true or a lie. hope it makes sense to you and any help appreciated as he as to deal with constant lies and now the trial is going to go ahead we can present the evidence and hopefully move forward and my son will have his sons rights upheld and also possiblily be able to have the eldest brother to ensure they are both looked after. thanks in advance.

Reasons for PIN. \"contacting his ex partner via txt\", yes only to discuss his child \" taking photos in super market\" no he was shopping \"videoing  the handover\" no His father did as his ex partner made a allegation that she had being intimadated when handing over at his home address and again no such thing took place. She refused to adhere to court order and wanted to meet at a location not covered by cctv . hence i videod it to ensure everyone was protected and she did not object she thought it was a good idea. The Court order. he must ensure his partner has contact with the child handover to take place at each others address when child not at nursery child is to continue nursery each parent to have equal contact. Social services are to prepare a section 37 report. My sons ex partner is continualy putting forward allegation to both social services and the police. All I have done is video recorded the handover to offer everyone concerned protection same as cctv would offer. The handover went without any problems or upset. I am sure if i had not of videoed it his partner would of claimed a more serious allegation. what advice can you give as we are constantly been accused of nonsense but the police have not allowed us to show our evidence to dis prove his ex partners allegation they are nothing  more than vexatious at best and are just being put forward as the social worker carrying out the section 37 report as already informed me it dont look good for us and that she agrees with his ex partner but yet she wont look at the video or allow us to put our concerns forward. I have asked why she is no longer going to interview my wife and I when she told she would be doing so. His  ex partner is creating a senario to divert the attention from the servere brusing to his child which he discovered. I am getting desperate to try and sort things out with the police if we can without taking legal action against them, we can only object to the section 37 report if it is bias and appears to not be imparcial. the social worker will not speak to us based upon his ex partners lies etc. We are not being allowed to put our version of events forward. Also a PCSO telephoned the social worker once she had spoken to me as said i was guilty of harassment according to the social worker who spoke to me on the telephone, I informed her i did no such thing and that the ex partner had said it was a good idea to which she replied she did not , i offered to show her the footage which would show the truth of the matter and she was not interested. I have spoken to a number of police who have informed me it is not against the law to video in public prior to me videoing the event. any advised appreciated   ',\n",

So he as had no opportunity to be observed with his son or put his comments or concerns forward, my son took advice of a solicitor who advised he request an addendum as the report clearly shows little or no input from him and the judge at the review hearing should permit him to have his say and instruct the social services to carry out another report or ask for his concerns and comments to be included as an addendum so the court have equity from both parties. We have being informed that the welfare list contained in the report is the legal part which must be followed , but the social workers appears to following the objectives of the welfare list but contradicts it by her recommendation. Ie currently 50/50 shared contact for 12 weeks, social worker wants to drastically reduce contact. how can that beneifit the child it will destroy the progress made over the last 12 weeks. my son agrees his ex partner refuses to follow court instructions and be hostile , it is his ex partner who as the problem when handing the child back to his father and keeps changing arrangements. My son just wants to following the court order but the social worker has bullied him into agreeing alternatives.\" Do it or dont see you son\". apparantly the social worker as also made a very misleading statement within the report  , by saying an outside agency have reported violent behaviour of the child but when the agency was asked their reply was they did not report any such thing childs behaviour is age appropreiate. My Son as no money to pay for legal representation at the review hearing.He is paying for legal advice he as had weekly so to save money and have legal rep at final hearing / trail. the solicitor advised him of the addendum request as thats all he could really do as the judge would normally go on the advice of the social services. Could you give any further advice that may persuade the court to leave contact as it is until addendum as taken place to ensure no further upset to his son and we have a trail so both parties can supply evidence and let the courts decide and everyone get on with their lives. regards  ',\n",

My son as not had anything from them written or telephone so spoke to court for advice on what to do, he spoke to a legal advisor following the court visit once he informed them that no directions or bundle had being received from the court or the solicitors. he was advice to speak directly to the solicitor and find out what is happening about the court bundle , he was informed by the solicitors secretary that they have being de-instructed by their client. My son then emailed the court and emailed the solcitor directly to try and find out what is happening about the court bundle. he as since had a reply from the solicitor saying the bundle will be ready onb thursday pm. What can my son do or request the court to do as he will have a none agreed bundle which he will not ample to time to read and prepare questions crossed referenced to pages in the bundle in such a short time period. further more he made a specific disclosure request to the court for information from the police and the social services requesting information to be used in court which was declined. this information is relavant to proceedings as he feels it can prove his inocence in all submitted allegations put forward by his ex partner. If the social worker who wrote the section 37 report fails to attend court can my son ask for an adjournment as he wishes to question her on the document as she as mislead the court and he can prove it or can he ask the judge to ignore the report and request a further investigation be carried out has he has lost all trust and faith in the social worker.

This simply clouds the issues. Do you actually know what perjury means? Its a very precise meaning in law and can only be proved in a certain way. So its most unlikely that documents could alone do this. It hardly sounds as if the judge was unfair- your son has an order far more generous than many. Just because documents are served- does not mean they can be used. Its highly likely the judge read them and took the same view- that they don't prove anything of the kind. Also were they served in time.- by which I mean did the judge give permission. If documents are not served by the set date they can't be used without the permission of the judge. This is to stop last minute tactical surprises. I have no idea what you mean about bundle procedures. By the time the bundle is compiled all statements should have been long served unless there is some exceptional circumstance. Its not worth trying to claim a breach over a one off holiday. If a pattern of breach arises- that's different.\",\n",

I know some women do this so the father cannot cope and end up walking away from the child. but my son will not give up on him.

If he did not send it to court then its his fault- hard as that might be to accept. Its a fundamental rule that all evidence must be sent to the court as well as exchanged by the parties. I cannot see why a social worker would want to lie unless they were being accused of misconduct. And what exactly are they lying about? Apart from the physical circumstances and location in which the parties live, a social work report is likely to be a statement of opinion. So the scope for lying is rather limited. I fully accept you may not agree with their view ( in my career I often disagreed)- but that's a far cry from perjury.  \",\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u'Hi Davidr. He hand delivered all documnets to be inserted into the court bundle to his expartners solicitor, he obtained a receipt for this. As far as the social worker goes she submitted a sworn statement to the court which at a prior court hearing my son made the court aware that he had evidence to show it was misleading to the court and that judge agreed with my son that her statement was somewhat contradictive of the evidence provided by a third party. (SS states she attend and observed child being disrupted and being voilent towards other children) My son wrote to the establishment manager who the SS named would confirm this to be true, and he received a reply stating SS have never attended and observed his child nor as the child being disruptive or violent towards any child or adult, they further express that the childs behaviour was age appropreiate and the only concerns that they had was who said they had reported this as it was not true. My son produce this reply to the judge who asked the SS to explain when and how see observed this when the establishment clearly states you have never attended. her reply was somewhat fumbled and she lay blame to the ex partner.The judge informed the SS to attend the final hearing as she would be questioned over her statement made as he had serious concerns of such a statement being made to the court when she clearly known it not to be fact. You may ask why would the SS worker acted the way she did and why would she not be professional prior to the court hearing.  At the early part of the investigation to a large bruise found of the child , the SS worker was charged by the police to carry out a full investigation, and evidence which come to light proved that the ex partner was not being truthful and the bruise was either a accident while in the care of his mum or other adult. Further information showed that it could of being cleared up with CCTV footage but the SS refused to look into it. she further made a number of procedural mistakes which my son and his solicitor at the time made her aware of . Resulting in a child protection meeting being cancelled because of a serious error by the SS worker. Apparantly she was repremanded by her superiors and then it was a down hill struggle to speak or meet with her. Again all this information was contained in documents which was both sent to the ex partners solicitor and the courts.Along with other evidence showing and proving his ex partner fabricated a number of allegations against him resulting in a Police pin being issued and he not being able to attend her address to collect his son for contact etc.He made numerous request for police to look at the situation equally they refused. once the first pin expired she set about having another one issed against him and again he was issued a pin , but because he could prove without a doubt he had done nothing wrong and on this occassion took the evidence to the police , they called him later and informed him the pin had being revoked as she had no evidence to back up her allegations. Again my son informed the SS worker and her reply was \" not interested you have done it \" but yet she still refused to come and look at what had actually took place. So she was taking his ex partner at her word and did not offer to discuss or actually investigate anything. I am happy to say i have scrapped up some money for my son to go see if anything can be done with a recommended solicitor. i will let you know what they advise. I appreciate your advice , but as you can imagine my frustration on the whole situation. My son as follwed all courts orders she just does what she likes and nothing is done. I always thought that the uk justice system would see what the truth was but in our case the truth as being ignored. Sorry for the rant but thats the situation and she is still using the child as a way to punish my son for him not getting back with her and like you said using him as a bargaining chip.  All my son wants is to see his son on the days ordered by the court but yet she still continues to create hostility and claim threats have being made when no such thing as happened. thanks again',\n",

I privately rent a student house and have experienced an array of issues such as electricity problems and damp, but from the beginning of October 2016 there has been a pest problem which I believe the landlord was aware of due to multiple mouse traps in the house. I emailed my landlord to get the situation and he stated that he would send someone over who bought in plug in mouse repellent and then said that if it is our fault we will have to pay but the repellent did not work and I am still experiencing issues which I have told them about. I was also given mouse poison which is only supposed to be used by licensed professionals as the pest control man told me yesterday. I told the landlord that the issue is that there is an infestation under the floorboards which enter through to my room and every night I am woken up by the noise of mice in my room and under the floorboards scratching which has caused me to miss university and the stress has increased my anxiety issues. On the 5/4/17 there was a pest control guy sent in who confirmed that we have a \"large infestation\" and he put in poison however the dangerous poison I have already is still in my room as he was not licensed to remove this. The pest control is coming back in a fortnight apparently but I do not believe I can stay in this house any longer as I have been finding mice in my clothes and underwear drawers and I feel like this could be harmful to my health. I moved out multiple times as I could not stay in my room and I did not pay rent for the months that I had to leave however the landlord is demanding that the house is 100% habitable and if I don\\'t like it then I should just leave despite me studying here. I would like to know whether I can get some form of inspection and if I am eligible for compensation/rent refund to be looked into as the issue has not been sorted since the beginning of my tenancy and I strongly believe the landlord was aware of this issue but is taking advantage of my urgency. On the 8/4/17 I received an angry and intimidating email stating that I was being ridiculous and lied about pest control stating there was a \\'moderate mice problem\\' which he did not say at all. He also asked which part of my living situation I am unhappy about as there is no need for me to be and threatened me with solicitors for missing two months rent due to me not staying in my room for the upcoming week. I just wanted to know what my rights are regarding this. Thankyou.',\n",

We are unable to agree on spousal maintenance as she wants to impose a nominal amount moving forward, which I am arguing against.The current situation is that we have a four year old daughter, were together for eight years, of which three years were married, and have been separated for almost two years. At the time of getting together, and up until our daughter was born, we both worked full time and earned a similar salary. When she went on maternity leave, I took on paying the mortgate in full, and she returned to work after maternity leave part-time (two/three days per week) as she wanted to spend more time with our daughter.Since separating, I have continued to pay the mortgage on the matrimonial home (whilst living in my overdraft, as I also have to pay for rent and living costs). We are almost agreed on selling the matrimonial home and splitting the proceeds accordingly - 60/40 in her favour. This will give her a nice lump sum as a deposit for another suitable property for her and our daughter (I currently have minimal access). I have also agreed to pay the CSA equivalent per month in child maintenance.The sticking point is over spousal maintenance. I am prepared to pay an amount until our daughter goes to school (in 18 months), at which time my ex-wife is able, qualified and has the means to return to full time education, earning the same as before maternity leave at the same level. However, she is asking for a nominal amount after this time, which concerns me somewhat. This is because paying a nominal amount could mean she can claim a larger amount in the future at any time for the rest of my life if she feels she wants to - for example, I get a pay rise, win the lottery, come into inheritance, or simply because she doesn't fancy working (which she is reluctant to do, especially when our daughter is full time in education). Also, I do not want her questioning me every time I go on holiday, get a new car, or similar....How would a court look at this paying of a nominal amount, and what is stopping her from claiming more in the future or stopping work, if she fancied doing so? Also, why should she benefit from any salary increase, windfall, etc. after we are divorced?\",\n",

Definitive map officer email - I am not sure why my predecessor did not notice that the route used along the Lane was not marked upon the definitive map..

I apologies, therefore, if the section 130A(6)(a) notice has confused matters again. Please regard the notice as none other than a formality X Council were obliged to serve after we had a section 130A(1) notice served on us. The latter deals with obstructions on highways and is a facility any member of the public can use if he or she believes a highway is obstructed and the highway authority are not doing anything about it. In the case of this particular section 130A(1) notice, we are not taking action because our records do not include the alleged highway to which it refers. But we still have to serve the section 130A(6)(a) notice in turn. It is then up to the server of the section 130A(1) notice whether the matter proceeds to court.We have photographic evidence the way in question was blocked by scaffolding and in-passable for a period of weeks (four years before the order started); in witness statements they claim to use the land frequently or every other day; no complains lodged during this period and statements specifying route was never obstructed only when we closed at the point the order came into questions.A legal right of way resided along the back gardens and runs parallel to the now proposed order, residing at the front of the houses along the lane; the legal right of way through the gardens has since been extinguished; immediately after, the now order in question, the DMMO was submitted. Can one be closed so close and another open? We are also trying to seek a statement off the previous land owner; to corroborate a neighbors statement that he went out and physically stopped people walking the route; that he saw down the PROW finger post at the top of the lane.This is our content for our statement of proof.

Silence might make this problematic. As to the other issue it seems to me you have two choices. You do not need their permission if the structure is on your land. Therefore you can go ahead and build. The practical issue is: a) Do you wait until the camper van is moved (presumably sometime in the better weather) and then do the work. b)Do you start court proceedings if they refuse to move the van. The advantage of a) is that it puts the neighbour in the position of having to instigate court proceedings if they think you are wrong. Whereas with b) the onus is upon you. If you have a clear cut report then that is helpful. If by any chance you can build without the van moving then you can go ahead.    ',\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u\"Many thanks for fast response DavidR. Very useful to know the silence is not relevant to civil cases. A couple of complications for you to ponder:  1) Railing unfortunately cannot be installed while Campervan is parked as its parked lengthways 15cm over the boundary. I think that is why it was moved into that position. They actually have 2 campervans (?!) and a car and the one parked on line of boundary is barely roadworthy so unfortunately I doubt it will be moved now unless we force it to be. It has actually damaged our small front wall in its current position as its bumper has cracked and displaced a 1ftx 1ft section of the wall so we were considering that this could be a useful reason for it to be moved back to where it used to be parked 40cm further over. What routes can we take to ensure van is moved?  2) There are some brick pavers laid on a 25cm strip identified as within the curtilage of our property which could be theirs - it's not clear. The boundary report identifies these pavers as tresspassing IF they are the neighbours property. We sent a detailed and evidenced communication on 11.11 requesting a boundary feature on the advised line or, if they were in disagreement, to provide their own evidenced understanding/undertake boundary assessment. The communication also asked the neighbours if the pavers were indeed their property, and if so to either remove or accept the installation of the railings may cause some minimal damage to a couple of the pavers. We allowed them a month to revert with a substantive response. Again they didn't respond on this point. One clear question I have on legal front is what are implications of installing railing over brick pavers, and causing damage a few. Can they successfully claim criminal damage when we gave an ample notice period and invited an evidenced counter claim? They have previously threatened criminal damage over a rotten fence post before so it's a likely outcome.  Please do not be misled into thinking we are being difficult. We have 65 A4 size disputes, complaints, ultimatums, threats and lies in the last 18 months usually over claims of our encroachment of 1cm. She has also been 'influencing' neighbours opinion. We have accommodated their wishes, hired professionals to advise, been reasonable and open, but nothing was working. In the end we asked them to stop sending emails unless they used a solicitor and now we are receiving solicitor letters.  A boundary determination recorded to land registry is our preferred outcome now and creating a barrier between vehicles seems sensible, as does marking the boundary clearly throughout the property to avoid future misunderstanding.  What do you think? What can we do?\",\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u'Firstly, I neither know nor care even if you are being \"difficult\". As a lawyer I concern myself with facts. Indeed most lawyers would go out of business if they refused to represent \"difficult\" clients. The issue is (put in its simplest form) where is the boundary. If the boundary is where you believe, it is not being difficult to enforce a right to enable you toutilise your own land. If you are wrong it will prove expensive for you to find out. Assuming no cooperation with your neighbour then you only have two options. a) do nothing. b) commence action. This would start with a letter to their solicitor stating that as a fact the neighbour is trespassing and requiring removal of said obstruction within 14 days. After that you would seek an injunction and you could also claim damages for trespass/loss of amenity. http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=402 It may well be that your neighbour will back down if you demonstrate you are serious. I would emphasise that I assume the surveyor you employed is reputable and sufficiently qualified/experienced. I should have added that criminal damage is not seemingly an issue. As you are seeking to enforce a right you believe you have then (even if you were wrong) it would not be criminal damage.

This allows him to use any income the house might attract (if he took in lodgers or moved out and rented the property) and also be liable for any maintenance and utility bills ..... also (not that it will happen) he could even sell the property but the capital from that would not be his to spend - it would pass to his sister's estate on his death.Her brother is in his mid ninetiesThe house was valued for probate at 125,000 (taking her brother's age and life expectancy into account)Her Net estate for IHT including the house value comes in at around 447,000 Given that IHT is being paid on the house from the deceased's estate is it now expected that her brother's estate will also have an IHT liability on the same house as it 'passes back' to the beneficiaries of his sister's estate?

But after he has signed this 'contract of expectations' what does this mean? What are the consequences if its breached? he cannot be recalled to prison for buying a dog but can he be recalled for breaching a contract of expectations?. on the surface It all seems a bit over the top on behalf of the probation service. if the care staff were concerned for the dogs welfare then why did they not report it to the appropriate authorities? I probably wasnt clear enough previously. The extra work for care staff is not looking after the dog but spending the time removing and rehoming It. This is how it was explained to me by the probation officer. It all seems a very strange carry on but then i dont and never have worked in the probation service. for the record i am an independent social worker brought in to provide advocacy around the care plan. This is a seperate issue and for me its one around his human rights. I have looked at the legislation around animal welfare and from what i've seen each case should be dealt with on its own merits and only people appropriately qualified should be making welfare assessments and recommendations for a dog to be removed, such as a vet or RSPCA officer.\",\n",

This site is open to any member of the public to use including people on licence. Therefore the person in question is fully aware of this enquiry and responses. He is also happy that no information specific to himself was or has been posted.  He does have a disbility but the true nature of it has not been disclosed as it is only relevant up to a point. He did not describe himself as disabled originally to avoid questions about it so went with something a little more specific choosing double leg amputee (after a well known disabled south african athlete currently in prison). I changed it to what it is now to make a point, being that it did not matter what the disability was. He was rather hoping to find out what a contract of expectations was and what the consequences of not following it could be. Could a person be recalled for breaching it? I suppose I should have just asked that specific question rather than seeking to have a 'general chat' about it. Although I always thought context was important so maybe general chat was the best place. I have since found out about the Animal Welfare Act which surprisingly covers things like animal welfare. It would appear people cant just remove pets from people's homes without an assessment being carried out by an appropriately trained person. If they were concerned for the dogs welfare why was this not reported to the RSPCA? Glad to see nobody on a law forum, full of so many experts, picked that up. Probably because you were too focussed on what mattered to you without actually asking questions to gather information. Anyway lesson learned, will not be using this site again.\",\n",

I've tried to be supportive (despitive inwardly thinking having numerous cars in a new devlopment and a single driveway is a ridiculous idea). Sadly they dont communicate welll and shout at me if i ask permission to get off my drive sometimes leaving me trapped through fear of the reaction i get. They happily park at the bottom of my drive and dismiss me if i try to request access. They have been using their property to park a couple of cars, i.e a garden lawn but they are doing a conversion for a few more of their many vehicles. This will involve dropping the kerb.The road is unadopted (its a new development) but it is highway ready and complete pending an adoption and therefore they wont require planning permission for the kerb (this has been checked). Can this modification be made without the developer knowing or indeed highways as they will potentially be adopting a road with these changes. In addition there are drains to drop, including sewers and BT chambers. Can the BT one be modified without BT's involvement?The reason i ask about the BT drain is since they have been bouncing cars up kerbs and onto this garden i have had no end of issues with my phone line, intermitent service etc. It just seems coincidential but i cant approach them to discuss it.Im not one for confrontation and i hate this situation. i just want to be prepared with the correct info and any advice would be great.Thank you for your help.J\",\n",

I was advised by our estate agent that at the time of the viewing with our buyers I made them aware that our conservatory gutter is potentially overhanging the boundary, which they accepted.

It was the neighbour that brought this to our attention- she said it looked like it was overhanging and even contacted our estate agent to tell them - hence their advice. As far as I was concerned, no measurements were taken at the time so it wasn't confirmed whether it was or not Anyway we are now having problem with the sale progressing.I have taken measurements and compared them to the dimensions on our deeds and I believe the gutter is not overhanging.To get the sale progressing again, I guess I am going to have to pay for a surveyor to confirm whether it is overhanging or not.The question is: if I pay for a surveyor to come and confirm whether the gutter is overhanging or not and I am correct in my measurments that it isn't - would I be able to recover the costs of the surveyor from the neighbour as it was her inaccurate statement to the estate agent that caused me to incur the extra charges of having a surveyor confirm that it is not overhanging?Obviously if it is found to be overhanging then it's my liability and I'll have to sort something!Hope this makes sense!

He was with my mother up until she passed away 3 years ago so fully trusted him.Anyway I found out he has been underpaying me quite a bit and has not provided me with the invoices he created to cross reference anything with my records.When I discovered he had been ripping me off I confronted him and he told me that I was owed \\xa3800 from the NHS finances department due to an issue with their accounts (he pays me not them) he admitted ripping me off and that his ashamed of himself then changed his story and offered me \\xa310.000 but I left very angry.After sleeping I messaged him in the morning asking how he wants to resolve this issue, he sent me a reply admitting he ripped me off again, defamation of charector too and offered me \\xa320.000 that to be honest shocked me, 1st he hadn't ripped me off then \\xa3800 then \\xa310.000 then \\xa315.000 then \\xa320.000 (all on text message on my phone)Since then he has gone and spoken to a solicitor and beleives his not liable as we never had a written contract although his the only person that's paid me a wage for a decade. I know we had a verbal agreement, hence the comment he only makes so much from my work.The defamation of charector is him informing clients I'm unavailable when I am and openly talking about me (he admits) but I beleive the company he spoke bad of me to will side with him if it went to court even though I have the message.The ripping me off is because he told me he makes so much for each job I do (he was making hundreds more) he has never sent me a receipt and I've only seen 2 invoices he created for himself for my work in 10 years. I noticed on one invoice there is an email address I have no knoledge existed so he may be using me to commit fraud as the email is my name but a provider I've never really heard of.I went to his house again and recorded him telling me his ripped me off after convincing him I wasn't recording by showing him a dummy phone when mine was actually strapped to my wrist (I told him the conversation was being recorded as you can hear me say, if he didn't hear it's his problem)As he claims I didn't have a contract with him, I complete domestic water services risk assessments, legal documents required by law in all buildings the public have access to for a big supermarket chain. I draw all schematic diagrams contained within the documents and rewrite all reassessments as I do not wish to be prosecuted for copyright.Is he allowed to reissue a document I completed with a name and date change once expired ?? taking less time, paying them more money then I ever got for creating the originals. They seem to have claimed my work as their own, or do the drawings and documents commissioned by him that I completed belong to me and fall under copyright laws ?Do I have any chance at dealing with this matter legally and winning my case, is it worth It ? There is alot more to this story but I think I will need a couple of days to explain it all. I also wanted to sell my house, quit the job and move away.

I think that maybe we should write once more to him stating that we have done our best to negotiate, and that we refuse permission for him to dispose of the car. If he takes out a lien on the car would that involve a court hearing at which we could defend our position?  \",\n",

So when a property is divided (i.e. there is a part transfer) it will show on the full title record of the property from which the land has been annexed. It will either be joined to the title of the property to which it is attached or more likely given a seperate title reference of its on. Either way it must be registered. You need to get a full title that shows the history of your title back to the date of alleged gift. If it is not registered then you should not be bound by it.

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"18 months ago, a UK based friend of mine, my wife and myself set up a small limited company in Botswana to import and distribute second hand clothing from the UK. My wife and I were to sell in Botswana, the friend remained in the UK. He was the sole investor in the business, to the tune of \\xa345k & had 50% of the shares, the remaining 50% divided between my wife & I. We have been trading for just over a year. The first year was pretty bruising as we got massively overcharged by everyone we engaged on a professional basis, from mechanics and printers through to accountants and clearing agents. We now have all the right people, through a very stressful process of elimination, but also of course had a large first year capital investment in vehicles, equipment etc. The upshot is that we headed into our second year much the wiser, with an extremely large customer base, but with a somewhat depleted working capital.To this end, I decided, for the good of the company, to resign my role as one of the Directors and pursue gainful employment in Botswana with a view to providing for all of our living expenses, thereby keeping more money in the company account to buy new stock and grow. My wife, as it turns out is eminently capable of running the business all by herself. A good solution to our problems, we thought.Regarding my employment, Botswana employment laws for foreigners are very strict in that if a job can be done by a Botswana national, it is not open to foreigners, so quite restrictive. I can get employed because I am a qualified airline pilot and although I am not able to fly (I have to revalidate my license every year at enormous expense), I can certainly do ground instruction. The government has just started a programme of sponsored ab initio commercial pilot tuition requiring both flying and ground school instructors. This is where I come in. One problem.Our UK investor / 50% shareholder has my license / paperwork I need to show to begin this job. I left these documents with him for safe keeping. However, despite repeated requests from us both, he is refusing to send them unless I meet his demands. These are my immediate & full resignation from the company, me relinquishing my 25% shareholding in the company, a cash payment of \\xa315000 to him and the appointment of a new director of his choosing. If these demands are not met, no license. His justification, such as it is, is that I hoodwinked and conned him into thinking I wanted to be part of this business just so I could come to Botswana, abandon the business & get a job flying. He overlooks the fact I simply can't fly without a recertified license. The best I can hope for is a gig ground schooling a group of people in an accent they barely understand, a subject they understand even less and field questions they ask in an accent I barely understand. Interesting, maybe, but glamorous? Nope. Anyway, surely if this was some kind of weird masterplan I had, I would probably have brought the documents with me.Anyhow, he remains intransigent, so my question is: Where do I stand here? While his position is definitely hostile, is it illegal? What he is doing seems to be theft (my license) and extortion (demanding money and my apparent annihilation before he considers returning my property). I can provide his latest email on request, an interesting collection of threats.\",\n",

He finally agreed last week that he would sell the property if I agreed to move out half a week every week whilst he has our child until the property was sold. I explained this was unfeasible and would take much needed funds from each of us should the property take a time to sell. He has now retracted the offer saying he will stay in the property and refuse to sell. We equally look after our child (although I am informed on a day by day basis whether he will be having our child or whether I am).

The offences being assault on both my brother and his wife. We had been drinking.To cut it short it was self defence. I had a row with my bro because he won't do more with my mother. I am her carer, I left a great job 2 years ago to care for her in my home because she was facing life in a home for the elderly. My bro has never helped out, never visits etc. Anyway his wife got involved(she isn't a nice person) I was pushed to the floor and kicked (I took photos of bruising to my arms) I fought back, swinging punches also. Police arrived. I was arrested and charged.On the court date I told my solicitor I wanted to plead guilty to get it over with. I am in the process of moving to a different town, far away from them. Despite them being responcible also. My solicitor wasn't happy and told me I stand a chance of going to prison if I plead guilty. Then he showed me the two statements, and I felt sick to the stomach.My sis in law stated that I had pulled her by the hair and threw her to the floor then repeatedly kicked her in the ribs. All untrue. Apparantly they went to the hospital etc to have it recorded. ( she is a clever woman) I do know she had one bruise under one eye, so the statement said.There was video evedence from the arresting police officer of me being arrested. It didn't look good me mouthing off that they were as much to blame and get away scot free.I had a chance of pressing charges against them but I thought not, as I don't want to antgonise them anymore. Before the police arrived that night they both, mostly her, threatened me with reprisals, such as their freinds, which I have met, and are of the nasty sort.I am due for trial on 13th of march at magistrates court. I was found guilty of the same charge in the 2000 (an ex girlfiend in a fight) other than that I have not been in trouble since but for a drunk driving and a ban in 2005.I am worried sick about my mother as she will be put in a home if I go to prison. She depends on me 24/7.Two years ago I took courses in Electrical Grid and Offshore Turbines. A guilty verdict will no doubt spoil my chances of work, but my mum is my main concern.So what I am asking is do I make provisions for her now, get her ready for the prospects of a home? Jut in case I get prison.I have been told by my sister that my bro and his wife are going all out to have me sent down, which will mean more lies. As I said she is not a nice person but a splended actress, he just follows her lead.Any advice will be well recieved and thank you in advance.\",\n",

There are two problems now arising from this type of modification. The first problem arises because cars have now become wider and longer, this means that if you exchange your Ford Focus or Vauxhall Corsa for a new Audi, Peugeot Estate or similar vehicle, it will no longer fit on the \"drive in\" but will be left with two to three feet of vehicle protruding out passed your property line and onto the public footpath creating a hazard for pedestrians, especially those with sight impairments or mobility problems.

The footpaths in this area are roughly six feet wide, if done correctly the construction will grade the slope of the ramp across the whole width of the footpath leaving a gentle slope. Unfortunately some ramps have been constructed with the gradient in the first two to three feet, then levelling off as the ramp approaches the property line. This leaves a fairly steep gradient on the road side of the footpath which combined with a protruding front end of the parked vehicle forces pedestrians onto the steeper part of the footpath. As we are now into the season of ice, snow and fog this means that in many instances pedestrians will be forced to walk on steeply sloping, iced up pavements, at risk of falls and injuries through no fault of their own. My questions are, are you allowed to treat the public footpath as part of your drive in and park with a large part of your vehicle protruding onto the footpath, and if, because of this a pedestrian slips on a badly constructed ramp, who is responsible? I have posed this question to several friends and have had various answers including, \" It must be the Council as they permitted it to be built\". \"It must be the homeowner as they have parked in an inconsiderate manner\". \" It must be the Council contractors as they have built the ramp in this way\". What is the general view of this and who would, in law, be liable?',\n",

So if there are several siblings as the nearest relatives then any one of them could apply. The first whose application is accepted then becomes the administrator. The administrator can delay matters but only for so long as they are under a legal obligation to deal fairly with the estate. In essence there will be a choice she faces. To sell the house and distribute the proceeds. Not to sell the house in which case the beneficiaries will become equal owners. The beneficiaries who want to sell can then apply for an order for sale which is likely to be granted as one of the factors the court considers is the view of the majority. If the case goes to court and an order for sale is made it is likely the sister will have to pay the costs which will substantially reduce her share of proceeds.

All went well for about 15 months, but due to lack of work my partner's co-director set up a separate company operating in broadly the same area and sold his services through this second company to a remote local authority. On taking up this new role he committed to taking no further financial interest in the first company, but as the new role was only temporary did not resign as a director of the first company. To allow for appropriate distribution of dividends within the first company class B and class C shares were created with each director having 50% of class A and 100% of either class B or class C. Three months after leaving the first company my partner's friend renewed his contract with the remote local authority, at which time my partner tried to get him to resign his directorship of the first company, which he refused to do.At the time of his departure as employee of the first company my partners friend had received about \\xa3350 more than he was entitled to based on the companies audited accounts assuming a 50-50 effort input to the date of his departure and had no further work input to the company going forward.My partner's friend is now in the process of suing my partner through small claims for a proportion of the profits of the company earned subsequently to him leaving and having no further involvement.Q1 As it is the company which will not pay the claimed monies can this person make a claim against my partner as opposed to the company.Q2. Does this person have a legitimate claim to any monies earned within the first company subsequent to his leaving the company especially as my partner and the company's accountants made numerous attempts to get the person to resign his directorship in the months following his departure?Q3. As the second company that was set up by my partners friend was in the same business area as the first and went against the best interest of the first company contravening a director's responsibility to work in the best interest of their company. Would my partner or the first company have a case for a counter claim against this second company?\",\n",

I have 2 trustees, one of whom is a family member and one who is a financial advisor. I have put the policy in an Absolute Trust with one of my children as sole beneficiary. Sadly my relationship withthat childhas broken down and there has been no contact for a few years. I would still however like to make some provision there, but not for the full value of the policy.When I set up the trust, I did so in such a way thatneither family membersnor future childrencan be added to the trust document - my child is named asSOLE beneficiary.I\\'ve since had another child and I am in a new relationship. I would therefore like to be able to alter the trust, but I know that with it being an Absolute Trust, that isn\\'t technically possible.Under normal circumstances I would simply cancel the policy and set up a new one with both of my children as beneficiaries, but I have contracted a serious lifelong illness which will prevent me from being able to get a new policy. As fate would have it, my illness does not meet the policy\\'s definitions so I won\\'t receive a critical illness payment.I would like to add my 2nd child to the policy (I never envisaged I would have another.) Is there any way by which I can amend the trust, or is there a legal workaround which would perhaps \"over-ride\" the Absolute Trust or allow trustees to split the payment to both children etc etc?I appreciate that this is a complicated one - my life is never simple :) Any help would be greatly appreciated.',\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u'This is very complex. On the assumption that the entire house and annexe is registered under one title and in your sole name then the legal ownership is undoubtedly yours.  However that is the easy bit. The beneficial ownership which is the most important is where the real issues are. I do not know if your wife has registered a Homes Rights Notice or your in laws have placed a restriction on the property but I assume not at this stage as it is not mentioned. Almost certainly your wife is entitled to at least 50% of the original house as I again assume that with five children you have been married some years. As to the Annexe you will find yourself tangled up in the law of equity if there is no settlement.  Almost certainly the in laws have an equitable interest having paid for the development. the argument will be what level that is. Clearly from one viewpoint the land is worthless - it would be unsellable on the open market as a separate plot. Clearly you would not permit a total stranger to have built an annexe. From another point of view they were able to build their annexe cheaply as they did not pay for the land. Therefore it had a value to them. As all of you failed to adhere to the most basic of principles and did not record the nature and extent of your agreement you all find yourself in a mess. For what it is worth I suspect in the absence of an agreement a court would probably find it hard to credit that you gave up the land unconditionally merely for use. I suspect the outcome would be the land would be valued on the basis of its worth to them at the time. However that is not by any means a certainty. How much did the extension cost to build. It seems hard to imagine with the housing market that a home valued in  2009 at \\xa3220000 which has a large extension of two bedrooms and a living area added is still only worth \\xa3300k.

A gate or stile would not necessarily obstruct a public ROW provided it was designed so that all persons (including disabled) could get through. The other thing that needs investigating is that the ROW to the frontagers must, by implication, have been an express grant as you say it is registered in the titles.

They have been provided for in the will (20% and 10% with me getting 70%) and there is a paragraph in the will explaining my mother\\'s reason for giving me the majority of her estate.   It is my understanding that claims for undue influence rarely succeed due to the legal costs involved.(The value of the estate is only about \\xa3100k.)

Our legal fees have been covered by our legal protection policy to this point. The solicitor has now drafted a letter for our approval whereby the other side would pay us back in monthly installments and reimburse the insurers. My question is this. As the offer is currently worded, the first payment of 1,500 would go directly to the insurers / solicitors and we would not start to receive payment until month 2. In reality, there is a good chance this guy will end up not coughing up anything. However, if he does, we would clearly liked to be paid off first. What is the protocol in these situations? We can't see anything in the policy. Should our repayments take priority? Thanks.\",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"Isigned a settlement agreement with my managing director of the company I work for in April with a leave date in September. I had an issue about not being paid a bonus related to loyalty that was paid to other managers who were male while I was on maternity leave and raised this with him when I returned. The business was about to make redundancies and I offered to volunteer over one of my team colleagues who was able to take on my job. I said I would volunteer if he would pay me all my benefits and PILON as well as maternity pay because I was trying for another baby & knew I would not get such generous benefits if I left - there was also a risk I was also hoping to be pregnant by the time I left. All of this was agreed and signed in to the agreement. When I talked to an independent solicitor for advice he explained that the issue regarding non payment of the bonus that had upset me could mean we could say that under the Vento guidelines we could assign some of the money as an injury to feelings payment. This was drafted in to the agreement & discussed with my managing director. It helped save me tax and the company NI on the payment too. It is important to mention that my managing director spoke to the global head of my function in HR (who I don't report to but is also responsible for me) about me leaving and he was fully aware the agreement existed. I'm not sure if he saw a copy but there were emails confirming he knew of an agreement and if he had asked he would have been able to see a copy. As well as this there was a list of all people leaving and their leaving costs to make financial provisions and I worked with the head of finance on this. The finance director also had visibility of this list and could see my proposed settlement payment so could have raised concerns at any time. After my agreement was signed my managing director said he was also considering leaving as he had recently experienced high stress and illness and it had made him think about early retirement. He spoke to his bosses and global HR head and they asked me (because I work in HR) to provide a breakdown of the exit package. I sent this to them in detail and the head of the global business signed an agreement for him to go in September. A new managing director was appointed from July and kept asking me if I would consider staying on in a flexible capacity to support them with some important issues, eventually I said I would. The head of legal was asked to draft a consultancy agreement for this with me & he asked if he could see my settlement agreement and I thought this was to ensure I had indemnified the company from liability of tax- which I had. This last week (my last week at work) they suddenly said they couldn't let me stay on which I was surprised about but ok with but I just found out that they suspended my expenses access and also the finance director asked the payroll clerk to stop my payments being paid- unfortunately for them I have already been paid my money last week on pay day. It is clear that they are investigating my agreement & I don't know why- I have not committed any wrongdoing and the claims I had were legitimate.my managing director at the time had full responsibility for the budget and these decisions and had signed off many settlement agreements without additional authority. I am now very scared because I believe they may try and get the money back off me or take me to court - can they do this?\",\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u'I confess I do not know the answer and I cannot find any case on the point. The Land Registry may be able to assist. It raises several complex issues. Originally it was Crown land and subject to a thirty year period. So clearly in 2013 that had not expired and title was still good. My guess is that the ten years starts in 1995 as it is the adverse possession of the land which starts time ( who owns it only goes to how long is necessary to bring a claim). Generally speaking when a property is purchased the purchaser is advised to check the property to see who is in occupation and check what rights they may have.  Clearly it would have been apparent on inspection and enquiry to see what was happening. So I cannot see why an application could not be made immediately. The real issue is that such an application is easily opposed which will prevent registration of the land in the claimants name. The actual landowner can then easily evict the claimant who is in effect a squatter (trespasser). It is therefore likely that the squatter will lose the land and face a large bill of costs. If the squatter wants to keep the land it may be better to make an offer. Presumably the landowner is unaware of the situation and has obviously been unconcerned about the factual situation.

I purchased the land in 2013 from the crown along with other plots in the area under separate tiitles. Upon inspection it was clear that a company adjacent to one of the lots was using part of it as a car park and had fenced it off securely.  I tried to ascertain how long this had been occupied and my research indicated that this was in the late nineties having been vacated bona vacantia to the crown in the 1988. As such they neither had the requisite 12 years or, as I found out, 30 years for crown land.  At this time I did not know about the LRA 2002. I continued with the purchase of the then unregistered plots which was completed in 2013 showing my company as the registered owner.  I now wish to develop the land and wish to negotiate with the occupier who has indicated that they can claim it under possesory title.  They did not submit a clam to the land registry before I purchased the land but have now occupied it for 28 years in total.  I have read that regardless of how long they have occupied it as the registered owner the 2002 act is what the land registry will use under a possesory title claim. If I read this correctly then the length of time it has been occupied is not an issue so long as it is over 10 years, and that all I would need to do would be to object to the application and proceed to stop the other party using it within two years.

I am employed directly by the agency, I am not a temporary worker.In my contract there is a clausule that states that I am required to work 40 hours, hours may vary, I am expected to be flexible, I am ready to work more than 40 hours and I know I will not get paid for these hours, I was also opted out from 48 hours statutory hours limit.I understand bottom line, I signed it and I wasn't forced to do it, but at the same time, while being involved in recruitment for a while, I know that just because something is in the contract it does not necessarily means it's fair or even legal.I have recently made a query with my telecom provider and data I received based on a mast/tower I am connected to showed, that last month I worked on average 85 hours a week! That's more than a double of what I should work, I am expected to do all these hours, and in fact, after calculating my salary, all these hours in fact dropped me below national minimum wage.I completely understand how salary work and how you're not paid for few extra hours, but it's definitely not reasonable to make me to do twice as much! I know that being below national minimum wage is one thing, but I am trying to figure out if I can look for payment, despite the clasule in contract, as that's definietely not fair/reasonable amount of hours?\",\n",

I made a verbal agreement of the cost of the move with the saleman who came to my home to initally survey the move. I received no written confirmation of the price agreed. After the first move I came to pay the salesman the price of the first move. At this point he claimed that the price we'd agreed on was only for the first move and not both as we had originally agreed. He insisted I'd misunderstood and ordered me to pay \\xa31,000 for just one move. I told him I did not have that cash with me as I was only expecting to pay \\xa3500. I gave him the \\xa3500 and he asked me to transfer another \\xa3500 into his account when I returned home. I felt confused and under pressure so I agreed but on returning home I realised that I'd been scammed and I did not transfer the other amount. I engaged a different removal company to return my goods who charged me \\xa3500 for one move and were professional, gave me the cost price in writing before moving and were courteous. I rang several other comapanies to check the market price - all of whom quoted me approximately \\xa3500 for the same service. This confirmed my belief that I had NOT misunderstood the quote from the initial company (I had clarified it with the salesman TWICE on his initial visit to my home). That was 6 months ago - since then the salesman has been phoning me and texting me about every two weeks. Some months ago I informed him that I did not intend to pay this extra amount as it was not the original agreement. He continues to call me and has now said he is engaging a debt collector and insists he will not cease to contact me until I've paid.

Since her death, my brother and his family are now living in my aunt's property, he refuses contact with the solicitor who was appointed joint executor by my aunt, he will not speak to either myself or the solicitor directly and now I have been informed by the solicitor that he has received a letter from my brother stating that my brother no longer wishes the solicitor to act as joint executor and that he has appointed another solicitor. The original solicitor has been working on my aunt's estate for several weeks now and is very upset about this, as am I.What I need to ask is....does my brother have the legal right to overrule the wishes of my aunt and remove this solicitor as joint executor...another issue is that my brother has vascular dementia and has in the past served prison time for fraud so you can imagine how worried I am that my aunt's estate, which includes an expensive property, is being mis-handled.Thankyou for your time.\",\n",

The other joint executor can however either reserve powers or revoke his appointment provided he has not intermeddled with the estate. It may be that the solicitor concerned does not wish to be engaged in an unwelcome dispute and therefore wishes to withdraw. He will be able to tell you if he has intermeddled or merely done preliminary work. If he has intermeddled he will need a courts permission to withdraw. Dependent upon the terms of the will if the original solicitor withdraws it is possible the will allows for the appointment of a substitute executor.

If Victim took reasonable decision and behaved in a rational manner, then D is to be guilty of whatever he intended to do. In this case if he threatened to just cause harm and not kill, then it could amount to ABH (I am not entirely sure of specifics).  The case of R v Roberts is more or less similar to this scenario. The V jumped out of a car when D started advancing her- D was foudn guilty as V did what anyone would do as it was argued in the court. In your case, the victim\\'s response wasn\\'t \"daft or unexpected\" and hence D would be guilty. Finally, it also depends on whether D foresaw results of his actions. If he somehow exactly knew V would die, then he essentially caused V\\'s death.   Another case (can\\'t remember the name but can search it up) was that criminal law is not readily charging hospitals in case they screw up. That is a so called public policy issue, otherwise doctors would not engage any victims in fear of imprisonment. There are certain features like gross misconduct (gross negligence) that, however, make a doctor liable in certain cases. Hence in your case, unless hospital treated V so badly, D would be charged with whatever he intended to do.  May have missed some other possibilities, but I believe these are the essentials.',\n",

It would be perfectly open to any jury to infer that anyone planting a bomb intended to cause grievous bodily harm- whether it did or not is an irrelevance in terms of intent. We have therefore a situation where the causal link between the defendants act and inferred intent has undoubtedly led to death.

There was also a purpose built pedestrian walkway that he could have used which was right next to him. I asked if everything was okay and he said yes. He carried on walking in the middle of the road disrupting other road users and I safely completed my reverse and made my way to main car park road where he was again standing in the middle of the road , but not blocking me or anything I indicated my intention to turn left, he said I am going to report you to your company? I said please do and I said he should take a picture of the number on the van and of my registration number. I didn\\'t think anything of it and then received a call later from my company asking what had happened, They informed me that he had contacted the police and is claiming hit and run.

My mothers will stated that he was allowed to live in the house until he died , then it would go to me and my sister. We was ok with that . It was moms house , she bought the house from the sale of my fathers house when he died many years ago , and it was my mom who had the mortgage. He was a bit of a freeloader. He was not ok with not owing the house , and believed my moms business and assets where much higher than they were.we got to our day in court . With limited funds and looming costs which would of cost my sister loosing her home, we had no choice but to sign a tomlin order, giving him the house and the engagement and wedding rings he bought mom. In exchange he would give us back my moms ashes and some personal items from our family history. We begrudgingly signed.We tried to give him the rings, which were the rings mom was wearing when she died , they were even still in the sealed envelope from the hospital. We then tried to arrange an exchange at the solicters . He refused . I presume he destroyed them sometime I between the inventory and court. Panicked when we asked for them and said yes.He died a few days ago , and as I see it the tomlin order should be revoked? As there is 100% no chance of closing the deal snd recovering items .Although desth is sad , please understand my family have endured 27 years of physical and mental abuse due to this horrible man . even after the tomlin , he was still parking outside my sisters house and smashing windows, death threats . It is almost like there is no justice if your poor. If you have money you can do what you want to people and it doesn't matter . The last court case wiped me and my sister out mentally and financially .Me and my sister are the only blood relatives of the owner of the house. He has since produced a new will leaving everything to a wine he new for 18months and my sisters ex husband , who has made a living out of preying on old and sick family members and sneaking into there will .Please help\",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u'My husband moved out over a year ago and, since then, has applied for multiple credit accounts using this address. Evidently, he has not been making payments and I have had a lot of letters, default notices and even bailiffs turn up at our address.I am concerned that, as we are not officially divorced and have a joint mortgage, this is adversely affecting my credit rating which has steadily been dropping recently, and that of my children (ages 18, 20 and 22) who are also still at this address. I am told that, as we still have a joint mortgage, I cannot financially disassociate myself from him and he refuses to agree to transfer the mortgage into just my name without buying his half from him. I cannot afford to sell the house as half the equity would not buy me another place to live. As things are, we cannot even get divorced because of the mortgage.As he has not paid anything towards the mortgage or anything else for the past 16 months or in the three months before he left, can I legally recoup any of this money from his share of the equity when the house is sold? If so, I could agree to release him from this if he transfers the ownership.Many thanks',\n",

Until a formal financial order is made or agreement reached, divorce does not affect your husbands legal liability to pay the mortgage. Of course having a liability to pay does not mean he actually does or will pay. By the sound of things his debts are likely to lead at some stage to his creditors putting a charge on his share of the house. This would not affect your share directly ( in practice it means that if and when the house is sold his share of the proceeds go to pay his creditors). Joint mortgages are always a pain in breakdowns if one party is difficult. The mortgagor will not normally allow one party to be taken off without theior agreement or unless the remaining party can afford to pay the whole mortgage.',\n",

What useful purpose is served when an EHO is trying to prevent the plague of littering.\" The EPOs are employed by a private security firm. Their employers offer a \"free\" service to local authorities. In return for issuing \\xa380 fixed penalty notices, the council pays the security firm \\xa360- regardless of whether the money is ever recovered or not.  I am not condoning littering but I have first had experience of being falsely issued a FPN by the firm in question. In my case I was lucky that on the day that the FPN turned up in the post, I just happened to strike up a conversation in the pub with someone that I later discovered was a barrister. He volunteered to make representations to the LA on my behalf. He assured me that I had not committed a crime, and, after his letters had been ignored a number of times, he rang the legal dept at the LA, they agreed that the FPN should not have been issued and exercised their right to make it go away.  My experience was stressful enough for me to attempt to ensure that others are not mistreated by an LA that incidentally is likely to pay a shed load of money (read: millions) to a private security firm that offers a free service.  My end game is to coerce the LA to not treat residents and visitors as cash cows. I hope that they will employ their own staff and use those members of staff to, primarily educate the public and then, if neccessary, \"fine\" them. Additionally, I hope that they will provide bins that are close to the areas where smokers congregate and to remember to that littering is not just confined to those areas that generate the most \"fine\" based income. Above all, I want them to respect the spirit of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act which defines litter as something that has been purposefully left behind rather than something that happened to hit the floor before it was   and intentionally (legally) disposed of.

She walked out 2 years ago, and has never paid anything towards the cost of the family home, ALL bills and costs have been paid by him even though she has been in full time employment for their wholemarried life (31 years). All of her earnings went into a private bank account to which only she has access. The house she now lives in was left to her by her mother and she sold a one third share to their son. She has changed her address to this house for post purposes but is still using the family home address for registering her car and for voting purposes even though she has not lived there for 2 years.My friend is wondering 1) Can she force him to sell the family home. Both sons have left and live elsewhere. 2) If she is claiming half of the house sale proceeds can he counter claim half of the money she has in the bank and half of the value of her share of the house she is now living in.',\n",

Who is going to commence the divorce petition? He has not even got to the start! If they have been married for 31 years the starting point for a financial settlement will be half of the joint assets. So he will have a strong claim on any money or property she owns and that would include any pension rights. Vice versa obviously applies. She can only obtain an order for sale through a court order. The answers to your two questions overlap. The parties can reach any agreement themselves. In the absence of an agreement a court will quantify the total matrimonial assets accumulated by both parties. It will decide the % each party should receive. The starting point is 50% but this can vary dependent upon circumstances. After 31 years it is not likely to vary much in the absence of some compelling reason. Your friend would be well advised to see a solicitor to seek a financial order. Incidentally it is up to your friend to notify the electoral registration officer that she has left.

He has offered to buy out her share of the house but not at 50% as he says she put nothing in to the house even though she was earning. As regards the electoral register, he removed her name from the address when the forms came around earlier this year but it would appear that she has re-registered her name under the address of the family home. He has also tried to claim the reduction in council tax, but she refused to sign the form supplied by the local council for this purpose confirming that she no longer lives there. The council have said that without her confirmation there is nothing they can do. The council tax at the house she is living in is paid in full by her son.

As far as the law is concerned she has put every bit as much into the house as he has regardless of whether that was financial or not. I assume she is on the title as a joint owner so as far as that aspect is concerned your friend is on a loser. Her assets appear to be a much smaller share of another house plus money in the bank. Put bluntly, money in the bank can be spent or disappear whereas a house is not so easy to hide. So when the sums are added up the longer your friend leaves it the greater the likleihood is that her assets will be reduced and he will lose out. As to the divorce one does not need to have a solicitor to divorce. Apart from which why should it affect him if she does not have a solicitor - her problem not his. So that is not much of an excuse. It takes about 15 minutes to fill in the form. I should have added that it an offence to make a false staement to the registration officer. Your friend again should make a report. The local authority are also out of order. If your friend claims the 25% discount the local authority are required to make proper enquiry if they refuse it. If they think he is making a fraudulent claim the onus is on them to prove it.  Your friend should resubmit the claim with a strongly worded letter saying he will refer it to the Local Government Ombudsman for maladmistration if matters are not dealt with properly.    ',\n",

Once he stops causing problems in one area he embarks on another. Because the wall is so close to the side of my house I would not want to be scraped by the blocks, hence having to walk sideways.

This is usually taken back by the company by not paying you your final expenses claim. My final expenses claim was not withheld and was paid to me. Additionally, my final salary payment was paid and my salary payslip and P45, P60 etc was provided to me at month end after the \"books were balanced\".Now, almost 2 months on, I have received an email telling me that I owe them \\xa3500 and to pay ASAP. From a legal standpoint, do they have any legs here? They had two opportunities to balances their expenses, by firstly not paying me my final claim, and secondly by taking it out of my final salary payments. Ordering me to pay such a sum \"ASAP\" (because of their HR mess up) this much later is surely unreasonable?Reading through my old contract, nothing is mentioned about being legally bound to pay them back for any owed expenses, after final salary payment has been made.Any advice on this?',\n",

A caveat has been renewed several times and theother side sought to warn it off but I entered an appearance to prevent them from obtaining Probate.

Theyinstructed their handwriting experts to examine the signature on the Will.However they say that there is some doubt as towhether or not it is my relative\\'s. I am convinced that the Will is a forgery but they have told me that they can only investigate the handwriting of the person I suspectif their expert states categorically that it is not the Testator\\'s handwriting.I obtained the opinion of my own handwriting expert last year who felt that it was probably a forgery.My Solicitor considered that he was not sufficiently eminent in legal circles and I am now minded to appoint another expert. I feel that my present Solicitors have lost interest in the case and would like to change to another firm but am unsure whether anyone would be willing to accept instructions ona \"no win no fee\" basis or structured payment scheme as I have already expended a considerable amount of money on the case. I wouldwelcome any advice on the way forward- do I have a real prospect of proving that the will is a forgeryand suggestions as to a handwriting expert.My Solicitors keep recommending me to take the case to mediation but I am not keen to do this for various reasons.

Also assuming you prove the will was forged is there an earlier will and if not how will the intestacy work. It is surprising the executors have not acted as until you settle or withdraw they cannot get probate and distribute the assets. They could of course take action themselves to force your hand and it is perhaps surprising they have not.

       " {'1.Init_Post': u'Hi,I am just after a little advice, my son has recently been charged with a section 39 Assault. The long and short of the incident is a middle aged man physically assaulted a female friend of my son, he and a group of friends did seek this individual out. The individual was involved in a physical altercation with other individuals and the police were called. At this stage the police were carrying out their enquiries and speaking to individuals. The middle aged man approached the group (it was unclear at this stage through the recording of the interview if the man was heading towards my son). My son thought he was approaching him as he was constantly looking at him and pushed the man away. During the interview my son and the police officer were monitoring CCTV footage, which concurred with the statement above. The police officer did agree that the individual did approach my son and his friends but had his hands in his pocket. My son did state that the individual was invading his space and he pushed him stating self-defence, there were no injuries to the man resulting from the push. I have no sympathy for my son, as he and his mates did go looking for the individual and were angry because of the assault on the female. My son has had no previous and elected not to have a solicitor present during the interview, purely because he was naive, Initially I thought he should just go to court and plead guilty, however I do think a police caution would have been sufficient rather than a criminal charge or maybe I am wrong.My question is should he go to court and take the punishment or should a seek legal advice; I just do not want to be lumbered with a solicitors bill if the outcome will be the same.

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"Hello - I'm hoping to get some advice on resigning, how much information to disclose whilst dealing with restrictive covenants. The situation is complicated, so please bear with me, and I appreciate any advice.The company that I work for was a small company which got acquired by a much bigger technology firm 2 years ago. Upon acquisition we were forced to sign quite wide ranging restrictive covenant agreements which incorporate the entire technology offering of the firm - which essentially covers the entire industry that I'm in as it's a huge end-to-end service provider. Sign the covenant or you no longer have a job. So whilst I sell service A and it makes up 100% of my business, I'm now restricted from services A, B, C, D, E, F, ........ some of which I know nothing about and have no interaction with, but others I'm actively involved in or at least have oversight of, and this covers both direct and indirect competition. But either way my current employer is involved in almost all aspects of the service industry, almost anyone who would employ me is a competitor in some form whether directly or indirectlyI'm considering some opportunities to change job. The main one would not be considered a competitor to my current employer, but they are looking to develop and promote a product which would be a functional competitor to some aspects of say service C - it's ultimate aim is to get the customer to the same place as service C but only doing so in a narrower fashion. I have seen lots of presentations where our current competitors are mentioned, but never this company.1) Given the situation is this likely to be a breach of the restrictive covenant?2) Given how broadly the covenant is written, would it stand up in UK law?3) How much information do I have to provide to my current employer upon tendering notice? Do I need to identify my new/future employer? Is there any consequences if I don't? Greatly appreciate any thoughts or advice on this.Thanks\",\n",

I bought it under the council right to buy so the deposit came from my sole tenancy. My ex paid \\xa34,000 towards solicitors fees and central heating which had to be paid before exchange of contracts. He refused to buy with me because we had an off relationship. He said he did not want to committ to me financially (despite having 5 children tog). I paid the mortgage and bills while he lived with me and made excuse upon excuse not to help financially. I kicked him out when I found out he bought 2 properties behind my back. He has recently been made bankrupt and has lost everything, now he has sent solicitors after me to claim a beneficial interest in my home. He has not produced one shred of evidence because he has none. His solicitors have asked for everything from me barr the kitchen sink lol. They want my bank statements, tax returns, P45, P60, pictures of refurbishments he said he did (lies) the list is looong all dating back to 2003. Now they have issued a Claim form (CPR Part 8).I'm not sure what to do now. The form is nearly blank apart from both our names Particulare of claim Tolata and his solicitors signature.

If there is such a number you can check with the court that it is genuine. If there is no claim number then you need do nothing except to write back to his solicitor and say that  you are referring the matter to the trustee in bankruptcy. However he has not got any real chance of a claim. Firstly if he has been made bankrupt that would mean any beneficial interest would have been become the property of the trustee in bankruptcy. You would have been contacted by TIB and as you do not mention it I infer he did not disclose the claimed interest- which is fraud. Contact the insolvency service who should be able to identify the relevant trustee. Personally I would not disclose anything at this stage and if the claim has been issued ( which is doubtful) seek a directions hearing at which you can seek summary judgment. You should have received a letter before action but some unscrupulous solicitors have been know to simply send claim forms to give the false impression that a claim has been made.',\n",

I have acknowledged their letters and tried to correspond with them but they are very agressive and only gave 7 days for me to gather papers 13 years old.

They went back to the family court and the judge basically gave them both a telling off and told them to follow the original court order. He has another court date set for a domestic abuse trial. Although she's claiming he's violent (which he isn't) she said that she has no problem with him seeing his son. (She's an absolute head case!)Today is the last Friday. He went to his school to be told by the teacher that his ex had picked their son up early and that the child was upset and screaming that his dad was coming for him. The teacher also said that the childs behaviour is going downhill because of all this arguing between them two. The child is 8 and he's picking up on everything. It's extremely stressful and I dread to think what emotional scars the child will have at the end of it all.Please can someone advise what we should do?? It's bank holiday weekend and nowhere will be open. What would happen if he was to ring social services?? Would they help in some way? Or should we just wait until the domestic trial and bring it up then?Thankyou\",\n",

The difficulty with this matter is that the customer was aware from the start that they would need to pay me direct and this was the agreement i had with the fitter. The reasons for this are to avoid the additional tax work that a contracator has to undertake is paying a sub contractor. The customers had been unable to provide their own electrician and as the fitter new me he asked if i could help out. I do lots of work like this and am careful to record who will be responsible for paying my invoice. Both parties have said the other is responsible and now I am unsure who is responsible and who I should persue. The customer is seeking advice and has said that morally he wants to pay me but wil not do so unless he has to. I met the customers on the day i was asked to quote and it was the customer who asked me to do the work. Both parties are blaming the other and they are aware that i will be asking for the money, I just want to be clear if the law states that any agreement, regardless of any alterations ( verbal or otherwise) is between me and the fitter or me and customer.

       " {'1.Init_Post': u'Hi, I\\'m an alumni from the University of Manchester, my girlfriend is still a current student there. Last summer we went back to see family in China when we were caught in a devastating explosion which caused horrific injuries to my girlfriend and my parents. Little did we know, when we told the \"friend\" who was meant to be looking after our pets in the UK, she decided to take advantage. She started living out of our apartment with her boyfriend and absolutely trashed the place, including causing a flood which caused circa \\xa310,000 of damage. When I got back to the UK and tried to have a conversation with her about this, she got her boyfriend and friend to ambush and assault me, but worse of all, she then filed a frivolous lawsuit because she managed to get a solicitors firm to take on her case on a No-Win No-Fee basis. As she does not have to pay for representation, she has been enabled to pursue this vexatious case on a low risk/high reward basis. If she wins she gets a huge payout, if she loses she can just leave the country as she is a foreign national, and we wouldn\\'t be able to pursue her liability. We\\'ve talked to many different organisations about this, including the police, the council, our MP, Citizens Advice, Legal Aid, various free legal advice agencies and charities, no one can help. The answer we\\'ve been given is that they are sympathetic, but there isn\\'t anything they can do and that we should pursue this through the judicial system, except if we do this, we lose either way. By progressing this all the way through the system, we are paying \\xa320,000 if not \\xa330,000 or more in just our own legal fees. If it were not for my parents, we would currently be destitute. Our previous solicitors firm agreed to act for us on a fee cap basis, whereby we agree how much funds are required to get us up to a certain stage in the proceedings and we then put these funds on account, when the fund is used up, they let us know and we decide whether we will put more money on account or where we decide if we want to stop instructing them and start representing ourselves. They have dragged this case out for 6 months already, and now aside from having used up funds we have placed on account, are trying to charge us for even more money, claiming that we owe them a further \\xa39000 and that if we don\\'t pay this, they will exercise Lien and won\\'t provide our files to us or our new solicitors. The solicitors on the other side, know full well this is a frivolous case, but because they know I own a property (which is mortgaged) are pursuing this case anyway, as they know we are caught in a vulnerable position and may not be able to defend this case financially and emotionally. They have already filed a claim for over \\xa360,000, even though the only evidence they have is the word of their client claiming she is a tenant, two deposits of \\xa3350 made into my account without my knowledge, a handwritten, unsigned tenancy agreement and a social media post by my girlfriend looking for a flat mate. This girl has taken advantage of us when we were at our most vulnerable, where every organisation has failed us and left at the mercy of solicitor firms who only care about what is billable, as opposed to what is right and just. We cannot even recover from the trauma we suffered in China, but have instead had to defend ourselves from this malicious lawsuit which has well and truly ruined our lives. Please help us find justice. Thank you.Edit, can\\'t post the link yet: You can find our petition on Change.org. The title of it is: Don\\'t let victims of crime become victims of the system.

I do realise that the onus of proof is on her, the issue is, as she is a foreign national with no tangible assets in this country, no matter how the judge rules on this case, the fact the case has dragged on this long, we lose anyway. We have spent over  15,000 defending this case to date. It seems likely we wont be able to recoup any of our losses. It feels as if the system is broken, victims of crime have no way to redress their injury when the perpetrator decides to file a frivolous civil case using no-win no-fee solicitors (especially when that perpetrator is resident outside the jurisdiction and has no assets in the country). Another question is whether solicitor firms who represent such clients on a CFA basis are or should be liable for the defendent's costs when their client does a runner. Blackstones solicitors who represent this person, knew their client had no substantial case, but decided to proceed anyway, in fact we have substantial evidence the solicitors firm KNEW we had offered their client her belongings back prior to solicitor firms getting involved, but chose to try to injunct us anyway.  \",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"My brother lives in a semi-detached house, his neighbour has recently moved in and has made several alterations to his own property which are having unforseenconsequences for my brother's property.The first change was to build a rear extension which runs across the rear of the house from property boundary to property boundary. When this was first proposed, my brother pointed out that if the extension ran up to the property boundary then the neighbour would have problems carrying out any work on the extension without coming on to his (my brother's) land. The neighbour told my brother it was his 'right' to build up to the edge of his property and he intended to do so. The extension is now in placeand my brother recently came home to find a Sky engineer in his rear garden, with a ladder propped up against his rear wall and preparing to install a Sky T.V. dish on the side of the extension. My brother told him to get out of the garden or he would set his dog on him. At no time has the neighbour asked permission for this work to be carried out and when approached he told my brother 'I am a builder, I know about these things and I am entitled to have work done to my extension even if it means accessing your property to do it'. This work is still not done and my brother is still refusing to allow Sky on to his property to complete the work.The second problem is at the front of the houses, where the downpipe for the guttering is on the neighbour's side. The gutter is, or was semi round cast iron. The guttering on my brother's side was renewed about 18 months ago as it was badly corroded. The neighbour recently told my brother that he was going to re-new his front guttering, which he has now done. Unfortunately the neighbour replaced the old guttering with plastic in a completely different shape. When my brother pointed out that he would need an adaptor to connect up to my brothers gutter the neighbour told him 'I am not paying for that'. He then went on to fit an end cap to the end of his guttering, where it would normally be connected to the rest of the gutter. The result of this, much to my brother's amusement, is that now when it rains, the rainwater runs down his gutter and jets out of the dis-connected endand runsdown the side of the neighbour's house front. The neighbour is furious about this and has now had a solicitor's letter sent to my brother demanding he do something about this situation. My brother has not replied to the solicitor but has pointed out to the neighbour that the problem is all of his own making and by simply fitting an adaptor in place of the end cap the problem will be solved. The neighbour's reply was to the effect that he was 'entitled' to change the configuration of his guttering and it was now my brother's reponsibility to stop the rainwater damaging his(the neighbour's,) house.I am inclined to agree with my brother but what is the legal position with regard to these two problems?\",\n",

The landlord only needed to protect the deposit in a government-backed scheme if the tenancy was an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST).  Most tenancies are of this kind these days. Since the deposit was not protected in the conventional way you would have to sue the landlord for the return of the deposit.  If it had been protected mediation under the deposit scheme would have been available. You can also claim penalties for the failure to protect the deposit under the Housing Act 2004.  The penalty used to be a mandatory 3 times the deposit but the government saw that this was getting to be too much of a good thing for some tenants and introduced an element of judicial discretion into the matter.  The sum awardable now boils down to between 2 and 4 times the deposit.  You'll need the updated Housing Act 2004, section 214 which unfortunately is not available online i.e. legislation.gov.uk.  \",\n",

Anyway my husband was lovely only for 2 weeks in hospital, when I got home and start having recovery, therapists and learn everything he started to calling me bad names, did not answer to my requests and spending time with neighbours , where he \"relaxes\" himself. The reson of my stroke were: stress, nerves and spray paintings which made my blood thicker. I use to aint with my husband. He was still paintins, even he knew that the doctor from neurology unit told it was a reason. He did not want to stop, so \\\\i warned him couple of times and called the police. After this he moved out to neighbours, took a loan from a bank ( we had seperate accounts) - I was 7 weeks after stroke then. I was trying to explain him about the stroke , but he told me he knows everything from internet, I tried to make a therapy, but he told me \"no\" and finally he moved out for good - 10 weeks after my stroke. Meanwile he told me he will diverce me, which I agree now - I has in double hell thanks to him , but he doesn\\'t agree it\\'s his fault. He did not pay any money to me and after a stroke I did not receive any money as a self-employed, he did not want to give me his statements from a bank to let me claim for even ESA. I needed to wait when he move to have tenant agreement only for me and borrowed money from mum, cause I did not receive any money also my husband took a lot of things when he moved, he told me \"these are mine I pay for it\". He is also addicted to pornography, we had a lot of fight about this, he never wanted to go to specialist either.he left me before when I got a birth of our daughtr - for 3 years These are main informationsI read that in UK You can divorce after one year from getting married. Is that true? Can I make diverce from his fault?

I electronically signed the contract the same day. On the 18th of April I called the HR department for the company seeking further information in regards to the pre employment checks. I wanted to give enough notice as possible to my current employer out of respect for them. I was told during this phonecall that I had passed the pre employment checks and that I could hand in my notice. This was also acknowledged via email. I handed in my notice to my current employer the same day. On the 26th of April i received an email stating that my offer had been withdrawn due to defaults on my credit report. (I was very upfront and honest with the company about having a poor credit report from defaults in the past which included a satisfied CCJ) So 8 days after I was told the pre employment checks were successfull and told to hand in my notice I was then told my offer had been retracted. Thankfully my current district manager allowed me to continue for my current company, This was an extremely embarassing situation having to beg for my job back after handing in my notice. I have been with this employer five years almost, never been in any disciplinary troubles and never been off sick. I feel that this is very much going to halt my career progression in the current company, I already feel as if I am not being treated the same as I was before I handed in my notice.My question is legally do I have any grounds for legal help in this matter. This has been handled terribly and very unprofessionally and for my career it could be extremely damaging. I thank anyone in advance who can offer some advice or even opinions on the matter.',\n",

However, given what you have described, it sounds as though the judge's conduct was entirely within his scope as a judge. He, and he alone, makes decisions about the case before him. If you don't agree with his judgment when it is handed down, you can appeal his decision to a higher judge, but only if the judge made an error in fact or law.

By your telling of the situation, you are irritated that the judge said he/she did not want to hear details of your 'sex life' - you call it 'rape', no doubt your ex will say it was just 'sex'.  Either way, if the judge felt hearing about it would add no material weight to the case before him/her, he/she has the right to dispense with it.  Whether you liked their wording of how they dispensed with it is largely immaterial. You need to remember that your allegation is just that, an ALLEGATION, the judge made no finding of fact, so it remains that, an allegation.  You presumably had ample opportunity to report this alleged rape to the appropriate authorities (i.e. the police) when it happened and to allow them to investigate at the time it allegedly occurred.  If you chose not to, you will have to accept that a family court judge will be less likely to believe it is a pertinent fact in the case before him. This is not a judgement on whether you were raped or not...just whether or not such information is relevant to the family court. You remain free to report the alleged rape to the police, and would be strongly advised to do so if you want justice.  Justice for your alleged rape is not likely to be found in the family courts in a child arrangements case.  \",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u'Just wondered if I might be ask for your assistance, until 6 months ago I was part of a new venture called The Field Of Dreams, it was set up between myself and a local charity to be a place with young disadvantaged adults and children could gain experience of a farm.The original plan was that the farm was to be setup as a limited company, owned by the charity, with registered directors being Mark Byford and myself. Initially I was to receive money from entrance charges on open days, while the charity paid for the initial setup costs through receiving grants and other charity funding. Longer term the charity was to start bringing local disadvantaged children onto the site, where they were to be paid by the local authority. Over the initial few months I asked on numerous occasions when all this was to be set up, but Mr Byford continually came up with different \"reasons\" (excuses) for this not having been done. This also went on with other legal details, including the rental of the land. After 6 months with still no agreements in place I started to seriously question Mr Byford what was going on and why these things hadn\\'t been sorted! Mr Byford then decided that the Matt and Beanie, two volunteers that had been helping out for the past few months while they kept their own chickens on site, had to make a choice, either move off, or donate their chickens, coops, feeders etc to the charity! They seemed to have decided to stay. At this point nothing was said to me.Unfortunately due to the fact I was not prepared to \"donate\" everything I had to the farm I ended up being told I was no longer welcome up there. I have now been trying to move all my animals and bits somewhere else, it took some time to find a new site for the animals and have now located somewhere, but on the last 2 occasions when I have tried to get the animals we have meet a torrent of verbal abuse. I only want to reclaim all that is mine, nothing more. Although \"banned\" from the site, I have been regularly visiting outside of normal hours to check on the animals etc, and all seem ok, however Animal Health and Trading Standards have recently been up there to check on the site. And as they say there is no smoke without fire. The verbal abuse we received on the last visit when we tried to obtain the animals has also lead to many of my friends not really wanting to help now. One of those who helped out also received a message through facebook,Hi Rob I understand you. Attended the field of dreams farm in thurston today to remove items allegedly belonging to Dave Muskett For your information trading standards, RSPCA and DEFRA have all been informed of his behaviour after he was respectfully requested to inform us when he would be attending We are considering taking legal action, could you therefor provide me with a full company name and address to send paperwork toI hereby clarify anything being removed from the farm will be classed as theft and dealt with in that manner. I hope this is clear enough Many thanks Mark Byford Crack On Foundation. I have tried to ask so many people now it is getting very down-heartening, all I want is to get my animals and belongings back, therefore I am asking anyone possible if they might be able to help. I am seeking legal advice as what to do next. I have a group of people who have agreed if it comes to it to simply go there and collect all that is mine! What I want to know is can they claim theft of what is effectively my own property? If you are able to spare a little time to answer this question I would be extremely grateful.

The flat roof of this new extension overlaps the parapet wall of our flat roof extension (built in the 60's) by approximately the width of a brick.We complained to the neighbours the day the work was done and despite assurances, from them and their builder that the overlap would be removed, 5 months have now passed and nothing has been done.Because of other issues arising from the extension build we are no longer on good terms with our nieghbours and so have been dealing with the builder directly, however, he is no longer answering my calls or emails.I'm now wondering what our next step should be. We want the overlap removed as it is a clear trespass. Also, if we ever need to replace our roof or extend ourselves we will have the cost of removing something which should be there in the first place.However, we do not want to go to court as we may wish to move house in the next few years and a legal dispute could jepardize that.

A brief background to the story: I am in disagreement with National Grid in reference to a gas disconnection due to them failing to notice that the existing meter did not confirm to the current standard and as a consequence I did not have any supply. National grid were appointed to install new gas piping to my property. They have had access to my property at least 4 times, to arrange visual viewing with at least 2 times taking pictures with an Ipad on the existing piping and meters. NG insist that no access was provided and that a Survey letter sent to me and placed in the communal area, was not responded to. I did not receive the letter, however prior to the installation they gained access and advised me the area where the meter will be moved to. Upon installation of the piping they had the 2 afore mentioned viewings where photos were taken.  8 months later from the initial pipe installation, they visited to transfer the meter from the previous piping to the newly installed one. On this day they noted that the meter was outdated and I will be disconnected for the foreseable future until my gas supplier provides me with a new meter meeting the current standard. This has led to 32 days without gas. While this delays was caused by the supplier, NG are adamant that with the meter being outdated the Supplier should pay me compensation. While that is correct in some aspect, it was them who initiated the disconnection due to their failure in identifying a disconnection risk. Having asked all the details held by them under a subject access request, I was refused as they are outside the FIA, however they replied to me with a brief summary: - Survey letter sent and not actioned by me (not received but in the communal area) - They access my property ONLY twice, the physical installation of the pipe and the other occasion at disconnection I am 100% sure that access was gained more than those 2 times, that the survey was made, as a consequence of which installation took place, that further visits were undertaken with pictures taken and that they had ample time and visits to notice the non-conformity of the meter. Many thanks for reading!  ',\n",

They then advised we were liable for a further 30% of the total sale. We contacted them immediately and advised them of the situation, but they would not budge and advised we were liable, but they would set up a payment plan. They advised that they would refund us any money if they managed to resell the booking. Online, the dates were available to book until we checked again this evening. We then noticed that they are no longer available. I called the venue to ask where we stood, and if they had managed to resell the venue, were we still liable for the remaining balance. The owner advised that the venue was still available, contrary to what it said online, and that we would still have to pay. Unfortunately, I don't believe her, and I don't know whether I should take my chances in court, or pay the money, and hope they will be honest with me eventually. I also think that if they are managing to get a booking for the weekend, then we should at least no longer be liable for any payment.

She died Intestate and apparantly according to the solicitor dealing with the Probate there in the UK. I\\'m told by them there is \"30 beneficiaries\" . I am now getting frustrated as the Solicitor is very guarded indeed & will tell nothing at all ...apart from she is still waiting for more response\\'s from 2 beneficiaries before she can finalize the accounts ......this has been the claim now for months. No updates to speak of are forthcoming . I have directly asked for the name of the Executor & the names of the other benficiarie\\'s but she will not divuludge these or any other imformation at all.Our relationship now is ...lets say strained !also she claims there is NO time frame parameters that she has to work within. I have know idea as to what she is legally required to divulge or the correct process entails & she is very evasive indeed ...even to the extent of rudely claiming that by just answering my emails will reduce the disposable estate further !!!!! I\\'d really like to know the full names & contact details of the other relatives & people involved in this so we come together as one & have some clarity, as I firmly believe they too will be experiencing exactly the same frustration as me & by us all being intentionally held anonymous & devided to each other......we can say & do almost nothing to expediate the process ,or hold the Solicitors to account in any way . I believe the Solicitor is intentionally dragging their Heel\\'s here in an obvious effort to pad out and inflate the Solicitors Charges to the estate .... the harder process appears ,the longer it runs, the more Meter spins !!!! I have done some research as to my Legal blood related beneficiary entitlement with regard to the Rules of Intestacy in England ...as there was mutterings from her as to whether I was entitled to anything at all ( it appears as a grandchild ...with no parents alive now ...well, I am entitled ) also, I have managed to find that my relatives passing was officially registered by the Solicitors in question on the London Gazzette Official Public Record on 29/09/2015 and the advertised Claim there Expired on 11/12/2015 & thats all I know . If any one can help by shedding some additional light on the points I\\'ve raised & perhaps lending some quideance or points of Law that I can then draw reference to ....this in an effort promote the Solicitor to be more proffessional, accountable & considerate ... well, I\\'d really appreciate your kind help.

I think most of your issues could be put down to a better \"bedside manner\" of the solicitor being desirable. In reality a solicitor can only have one master in this type of case- the executor. If the solicitor has to to be at the beck and call of a large number of beneficiaries ( each with their own take on things) matters would get complex and expensive. Plenty of wills create as many issues as the solve. If a will is worded so that the benficiaries share out a % of the total estate rather than a specified item or sum there will frequently be arguments about what happens to particular items of jewellery or paintings, the valuations obtained, whether the deceased promised this or that to x or why. The list is endless. Believe me not every beneficiary is grateful! There are rights- it is just that they come late in the order of things rather than at the start. So beneficiaries must be given a copy of the accounts and asked to approve (safeguard against fraud).',\n",

I had attended a meeting the previous week where I was told I should be back at work the next week (the week of my termination) after the reviewing of statements regarding the September 21st incidents - BUT - the statements from staff? regarding an 'incident report' I had put in regarding a patient - in August of the same year was also being reviewed. This was a separate incident. Once they were reviewed I would be allowed back. I had no idea it was turned into such an investigation and feel it was used as an excuse to keep me off work. The statements related to this August issue were dated 4th October. I had a security meeting about the patient on the 14th October. My contract was terminated in relation to the statements of the August incident. The patient had hit me another member of staff and distress other patients to the point that I had to intervene. I submitted an ACAS form on the 8th October 2015 when I became concerned with the delay in me getting me back to work. acas contacted the employers but I cannot remember the date. They replied With some excuse about matters ongoing and to be resolved and that I should be back. My certificate was issued on the 8th November. I was sacked on the 13th. I applied to tribunal in January 2016 after I had sufficiently recovered from illness. I'm sure it was within the three month time limit. The August incident was referred to the DBS in March 2016. There are now four witnesses statements instead of two Gathered from meetings conducted after gathering statements revealed in the termination meeting? 1. Is my dismissal date, (a) the date the I was suspended (made unavailable until further notice), the 21st September? (b) the 5th November the date on the invitation letter indicating that an outcome of this upcoming meeting (11th November) ' of my bank contract? (C) the email dated 11th November rearranging the above meeting suggesting '' after I was unable to attend the above due to lack of finance causing travel restriction? Or (d) the date or day of the actual 'termination meeting' on the Friday 13th November which I attended and where I informed I was now sacked 20 min before I left the meeting?Please Remember I was a bank worker.  2. Regarding an ACAS application deadlines is my dismissal date the 21st September the date of being 'made unavailable until further notice' or the 13th November 2015 the date of termination meeting where I was told that my contract was indeed to be terminated? 3. What are the possible breaches of employment law issues evident here. I am black British (carribean). Thanks\",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"A cyclist hit my car as I was pulling out of a junction in October last year.He flew into the back quarter of my car damaging the rear wheel arch and causing several hundreds of pounds of damage.He was a 13 year old lad riding on the footpath at speed with no helmet at speed. At the junction h e went down the dropped kerb without stopping into the road where he hit my car that was already pulling out of the junction. I checked he was ok and asked if he wanted me to take him home (his parents lived in the flat below me).He said he was ok and apologised for riding at speed into my car and said it was his fault.I called the insurance purely to tell them what had happened and that I intended his parents to pay for the repairs.I wanted to make them aware should an injury claim by the cyclist be sought.I asked if I should call the police and they advised that it would probably be a waste of the police's time as we had both left the scene and we're both ok.The drivers parents eventually paid for the repairs to the car (in cash - so no record of this).I have just received the insurance renewal quote.My 2 years no claims is displayed as 0 years no claims.There is also a log in the claim section to advise 'Driver hit third party', claim cost \\xa30.They've increased my monthly premium from \\xa354 per month to \\xa3228 per month?I've contacted them to ask why and they've advised that should the cyclist claim against me with a year of the incident, then the court will approve it, hence the increase to my insurance premiums.They said that if I obtain insurance elsewhere (foregoing) my no claims, then the open incident will be displayed which will increase my insurance premium with any chosen provider.I am in the process of sending photo's of my car to the insurer so they can see I didn't hit the driver, the driver hit me as the damage was at the back quarter of the car.Also to argue that the cyclist hit my vehicle.Any advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated\",\n",

So, the landlord passed the case to DCBL: Certificate Bailiffs & High court enforcement. I realized what happened when an agent from this company called me in october, explaining me the situation. Since then, I tried to contact my friend, which has moved to Italy, asking him to pay, but he does not want to. So, this people want to get the money from me. At the moment of signing the contract I have provided only few informations, as my full name, DOB, telephone number and my previous accomodation address. I am afraid that if they don't see the money soon they will initiate a legal action against me. I'd like to know if there is any chanche to take myself out from this situation.Thanks a lotJack\",\n",

I assume the terms of the will merely state a three way split in general terms as opposed to stating that you will each have a one third share in a specific asset such as the house. The duty of an executor also includes the requirement to act reasonably. Hence an executor who sold a property to a relative for under market value would be liable for a breach of duty and would be liable for damages. If the house is up for open sale it must be relatively easy to find the estate agent who is dealing with the sale. Any prudent executor will get at least two if not three independent valuations so that they can demonstrate a fair price was obtained. You can remind your sister of this. As relationships are seemingly so bad it may be that a solicitor letter emphasising that her actions as executor are being monitored and will be open to challenge may help.

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u\"We got a phonecall out of the blue on Friday afternoon from a vet miles away saying they have our dog and have got her details from the microchip. This dog we had fostered and then found a new forever home for her 18 months ago when she was about 5 months old. We had had her vaccinated and microchipped so she was fully registered into our names, so when adopting this dog the owners were passed the signed paperwork for them to change the details for the microchip. They were also given the second part paid in full vaccination appoinment to get done and asked to change her into their address so she is no longer linked to our account. The vets on Friday stated to us the dog had been running loose on the main A30 and nearly caused a RTA and risked being killed, so someone stopped and retrieved her from the middle of the road and took her into the vets. She was not wearing an id tag so the microchip info was sourced. We were very concerned for the dog's welfare. We no longer had the new owner's (the adopters) contact details - neither full name, address or home number (the lady had sent us one photo on our mobile over 10 months ago which we couldn't retrieve and was subsequently deleted, so we couldn't make contact with them). I contacted my vet to see if the dog had in fact had her second vaccination and if the new owners either transferred her over to their own named account or if another vet had asked them to fax over the pet's history. Although the vaccination had been done, neither a vet nor the owner had transferred the dog away from us, so we couldn't get any contact details that way.  My vet told us she was our responsibilitly and we should collect the dog as she could have been rehomed and or abandonded and as registered to us we would be responsible for both the dog and all costs and bills and our rights were not relinquished as we'd thought. I telephoned the vets back an hour later and explained I would have to get a taxi to collect our car at my husband's work but hoped to be there before they closed (to not incur overnight care at the vets). I collected the dog out of legal obligation; we didn't want the RSPCA claiming that we were the ones to abandon her, or to mount up huge costs if no one else claimed her it would have come back to us and us alone. When we got the dog home, although in good health and condition it was very clear the dog had not had any form of dog training continued. She snapped at our own dog (who had been around when we fostered her), got over a fence and attacked a chicken and constantly terrorised our cats. She was hyper-vigilantant ready for the kill on seeing a chicken or cat and no way could she remain with us and be a real risk to our family pets. We didn't know at the time of collecting her this would be an issue, as when she was a young puppy we were training and socialising her and she was acting appropriatley with supervision. That night she barked and howled all night long, destroying a dog bed we had provided her with and attacking her crate to get to any cats. We were at our witts end by Saturday morning - we had been checking Gumtree, Preloved, Pets4Home, Cornish radios, missing pets and lost and found pets pages in cornwall on facebook to see if the owners had reported her as missing, but to no avail. At 11am I started ringing around the rescue centres to admit her - three said no and they all had long waiting lists which I was put on at least one. One told us they had no hope in hell of re-homing such a dog with existing pets and have we thought what is best for her if long term pound was her only option.....being PTS We checked all the sites until mid afternoon, as we could no longer keep her in our home, then put her up for adoption for a nominal fee of \\xa350 to ensure a good home. We found and home checked a pet-free couple who longed for a dog local to us and spent a good deal of time with them. We expressed concerns over the height of a damaged wall which they assured us they would get sorted and raised and in the meantime wouldn't let her off and would use an extendable lead in the garden as we explained what had happened at ours the night before. Apparantly, on Saturday morning the adopters had contacted Lost and found at Petlog so they knew then that the microchip was still registered to us. They knew where we lived and had our home and mobile numbers yet failed to make contact with us until Monday late afternoon (why did they wait so long?). When they eventually phoned us we explained what had happpened and were totally honest and upfront with them and stated how sorry we were that we hadn't been able to find them and had unfortunately had to rehome her after 24 hours. We invited them to come right away to our home so we could quickly get the matter sorted. They did come here and we contacted the people who had had the dog for 48 hours at this point and again explained the adopters had now made contact and could we sort this out as they want their dog back. They refused and also threatened us that if we gave their name, address or telephone numbers out they would take legal action against us. We were on the telephone with the adopters present and having a three way conversation until 9pm but nothing was resolved. Tuesday I spent all day on the telephone mediating between the two couples. I spoke to pet log who confirmed that the adopters had never logged the paperwork for the chip to be changed and it was never pending like she claimed - she only contacted petlog re the chip today. I was deeply upset - there had been a catalogue of errors to have had this happen - the microchip was NEVER changed, the dog was NEVER taken off our vet account and the dog DIDN'T have a legal tag or engraved collar with its up-to-date details on.  We took back a dog who was dangerous around our much loved family pets who mean a lot to our children too and we were placed in a desparate situation where we needed her safe and away from us. This has caused me and my family so much upset and stress and we have tried to help solve this matter at all times. We have been harrassed by both other parties at one time or other. We have  put the welfare of the dog first. Don't forget - we had no way of knowing if the dog had been abandonned. We didn't even know if she was still with the people we'd originally passed her on to. All we knew was that we were the only people that the dog could be traced to (vet records, microchip) so we actually then had a legal duty on us to ensure the dog's best interest were met. Unfortunately that meant having to rehome her again and that we did - finding new owners and checking out that they and their home were suitable. We even told them the circumstances by which we had the dog back in our possession, so they knew the facts from the start. Today both parties seem to have posted on the same forum. This seems to have forced the people we rehomed the dog to at the weekend to phone us today and relent to give the dog back. my husband then asked if we could give out their contact details for them to sort the matter out between them (previously we had not been allowed to do this) and they said yes this time. We were again hassled to return the \\xa350 immediately. However, only when given proof that the dog was safely returned to the adopters did my husband then immediately release the \\xa350 back to the couple who had her since Saturday night (by immediate bank transfer like they had paid to us in the first place, with a siged re-homing letter with our details, vets and past history, so full transparancy at all times). I hope this puts our facts across and that the actions we took were nothing more than putting a dog first. This was not an act of theft, fraud or deception in any shape or form. It's a series of errors and circumstances which thankfully have been resolved with the dog back with the adopters. They now need to ensure the dog is fully registered with them - they have legal obligations  to ensure the dog can be traced back to them AT ALL TIMES - which means getting a proper tag or engraved collar that doesn't fall off all the time (remember there is a huge fine if a dog's details are not correct). Ensuring microchip details are correct at all times and ensuring vet ownership is transfered and up-to-date would have prevented all this happening in the first instance. You cannot rely on previous owners to know who the dog is currently with and their address details and only ever acted in the dogs very best interest, at very great cost to us - it is the current owner of an animal that has to ensure these are all in place.\",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"HiI purchased a car in 2015. It's had over 10 issues. The dealer can take weeks to repair each time, and in some cases orders parts incorrectly so needs a few goes. The last issue couldn't be identified by them, so I took it to a local garage who advised the issue. They said it was bad fuel, or a struggling engine. Turned out to be a bent drive shaft.I complained to my finance company and they did a full investigation including a court approved engineer to confirm the dealer had repaired it incorrectly, which has potentially caused further damage to the car. They even broke something else on the car. I was offered \\xa3500 as a gesture but it doesn't cover the \\xa3\\xa3\\xa3\\xa3s I've encountered so rejected this and opened a case with the financial ombudsman. All costs have been recorded.Their courtesy car was supplied with a bald tyre, which failed whilst driving. Safety risk!! It took them three weeks to reimburse me after I had to pay for a tyre myself. I was also forced to purchase insurance myself as they failed to respond in time and didn't know what the situation was. They refuse to reimburse for that insurance due to their lacks of comms. They then forced me to accept two out of five outstanding repairs on the car or the courtesy car would be taken away and/or action would be taken. I would be left stranded in the countryside. I was under duress accepting that. Now they have blamed me for a crack that's appear on the courtesy car windscreen and asked me to pay for it. How do they know it was me? They said they checked the car over over before being supplied, which I disputed otherwise a bald tyre wouldn't be present! I hadn't signed anything when the courtesy car was handed over too. I'll wait for the financial ombudsman to finish the report, but legally where do I go next? Is a small claims court enough? The \\xa3\\xa3\\xa3\\xa3s it's cost me along with supplying a courtesy car with a bald tyre and blaming me for the crack...this is more than a small claims court, or is it?ThanksChris\",\n",

However, as \"action would be taken\" and I would be driving their courtesy car without permission, and they wouldn\\'t insure the car I was under duress and forced to accept the repair. It\\'s all written down as evidence.  I challenged the whole lot at every step, hence why I opened a complaint with the finance company. The findings of the court approved engineer proved they repaired it incorrectly. The financial ombudsman is still looking into it all. Regarding the insurance I had to pay for... I was waiting for them to confirm if they were proceeding with the repair or not.

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"Hello need adviseI started a new job working for a large motor company. The job was as an eCommerce administrator. In my first day of being their I was told if I did not learn quickly I would be out of the door on my second day the manager again made a very long speech saying if I did not pick things up quick I would be sacked on my 3rd day again he said this but also made reference to my last employer and said you will be sacked again also here wont you.Then when I came in just before new year he told me if I do not improve or think I can do better to not to bother coming back in the new year. I thought the job was to list products and make the listings better on their ebay store as he during the interview talked alot about what I can design on photoshop I even showed him new designs I had done before the second interview happened. I was led to believe my tasks would be sorting out the ebay store but what I ended up doing was inputting data from excel into a computer system when was stock control I did this about 4 hours a day transferring stock from one system to another and creating invoices for orders. This was not mentioned in the interview and I found myself doing this alone while the manager did very little work and even spent half the day out of the office. I was doing other jobs too such as answering phone calls emails and ebay messages all relating to car parts. Then a new person started I was told he would be doing some of the invoicing but as 4 weeks went bye he never did any.I reported my manager to HR for his behaviour and when the gm talked to him about what he said to me he denied everything he ever said to me.The gm manager then said I am not calling you a liar but the manager said he never said anything to you. In my opinion this is calling me a liar as I had no motive to lie.Then at my first month probation he came up with mistakes I had made such as not writing down the details of an order I had made and the odd mistake on the data input I was doing. This manager had recorded dates on when I had made a mistake and what the mistake was as a new starter you make mistakes. I informed the gm I was dyslexic as I wanted to be honest.Then I was told you have a month to improve then in my second probation the manager came up with 13 errors I had made but according to him he only told me about 4 of them. Again I told the gm I did not come here to do data input and would you go to someone who treated you like shit when you started the managers method of training was it was up to me to ask questions all the time and make notes he expected me to ask all the time. Their had been no training structure.Then because the Gm did not understand all the ins and outs of what I had done wrong decided to bring the manager into the meeting and he went on telling what I had done wrong with the data inputting small mistakes out of like 1000 orders over weeks. Basically putting wrong figures in but this was a job I never wanted to do. I was still trying to get my head around the system. I then said you don't come to someone who lies and denies saying things when you said those things he did not deny saying those things to me in this meeting.The Gm also asked me why I had thought I was going to get sacked as I had asked the admin Secretary for advise on should I resign as I thought the writing was on the wall as the HR manager does not attend probation reviews for no reason. I had packed my bag in my little office which I shared with my manager and he had seen this and told the gm about it. The gm went on asking why I had packed my bag I said well I thought you was going to sack me I was shocked he even asked me this question at all.Then he said I am terminating your probation and you have the right of appeal and you will get one week pay and then he escorted me from the building it was convenient that the manager was not in the office when I collected my bag.That is the storey so what do you think? Should I appeal some people I talked to think it was a joke thanks.\",\n",

We\\'d both been at uni in the north of England and moved to Edinburgh.We started working at a small call centre which I helped him buy out and take over.I became a 10% shareholder and director in a company that has grown ever since. In the articles of agreement we agreed that only employees had the right to be shareholders and directors. i took on head of compliance - monitoring recordings to ensure customers wereserviced responsibly, guidelines followed etc.In 2014 my uni friend and I had a disagreement that meant things have been socially cold between usever since. (He left his wife who was also my friend and began an affair with a woman who was a call agent. Moving in together she has been promoted and given shares by him. In a lot of boardroom negotiations with other companies she has taken a place I once occupied. I think he thought I\\'d taken sides with his ex wife against him which I think I had.)Anyway, my standing in this now fairly large company remained secure but I found I was increasingly frozen out of thesocial side of things - corporate events, charity functions etc at which I was usually at the centre of alongside the uni friend.I remained professional but was not a little hurt by this.Come the end of January acorrective email about compliance misinformation that I sent his now girlfriend was called out by him as\"bullying\". There was no way that it was. Howver the following Friday - the end of January just gone - a rudimentary oversight (an hour of evening\\'s calls not monitored) was called out by him as a dereliction of duty and \"an attempt to bring the company into disrepute\" which I found utterly laughable. He then ramped this up, having our HR head draft a letter notifying me of suspension. I was suspended from work (a company I have shares in and am registered at companies house as a director of) and not to return until a disciplinary hearing to be chaired by him (he is the majority shareholder and managing director) at which I imagine i am to be sacked perhaps.I know of many double dealings and skimming-from-the top he has done over the years but have no evidence of this.

Customer didn't turn up, case was adjourned, didn't turn up again, judgment was awarded in my favour.Judgment was not paid so I applied to the high court who arranged for their enforcement officers to make a visit. The first attempt was unsuccessful and the same with the next visit.The defendants then applied for the judgment to be set aside, the judge dismissed this so enforcement officers made another visit.Then I received a letter from the defendants via the high court detailing various legislation and claiming that they are classed as a vulnerable household due to health issues backed up with a doctor note so any further visits from bailiffs / enforcement officers will be classed as harrassment and they will take action if the visits continue. The high court enforcement agents closed the case!So then, determined not to give up, I applied to the small claims court for an order that the defendants attend court for questioning. On the understanding that the defendants can't ignore this as they would be in contempt of court, I thought maybe I could obtain their bank details this way and the court could then arrange for their bank account to be frozen until he debt had been paid.Anyway I paid for the court order and also paid for the bailiffs service to serve it but the defendants have avoided the bailiffs and they have failed to serve the order and the court date has been and gone.So, where do i go from here? How can I get the order served to them if they just hide behind closed doors, as it has to be personally served this seems impossible!Any other ways I can try to get what I am owed from these people?Thanks all.\",\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u\"Thank you for your prompt reply. The history is convoluted: Brother took a mortgage with our father to buy their council house, but reneged. Dad worked past retirement until too ill. My husband was a bank manager and able to arrange a mortgage in which each sibling paid \\xa3100 per month. Mum & Dad retained joint ownership. We signed a Deed of Trust that Mum and/or Dad could remain in the property until death, then we would each receive a share of the proceeds of sale, according to how much we had paid in. After a couple of years I divorced so could not continue. My brother and sister did not have to increase their monthly payments or pay longer than expected. Mum inherited a legacy which allowed her to redeem the mortgage and in consequence, she stated in the will that \\xa310k from the proceeds of sale of the property, plus any other residual monies should be equally divided by three. As far as I am concerned that is fair and reasonable - I do not want more than I am entitled to. However the problems began when my brother and sister wanted to keep the property to rent out. At first they asked if I wanted to join in, or have them buy me out. But they refused to give me any figures so that I could decide the best way forward. Eventually it was clear that they would buy me out regardless of my wishes, and proposed to do so at less than market price. I objected, rang a few local agents and happened upon one who had valued the property for probate - \\xa3250k in Nov2013. In July 2014 she would market it at \\xa3280-300k. She said she rang my brother in Jan&Feb 2014 to tell him the price had risen. I suggested to my brother the fairest way was to get three more agents' estimates and settle at average, alternatively put property on the open market then match the best offer. That is when they decided to call in a surveyor (at a cost of \\xa3570 which they deducted from the estate). But of course the bluster about 'buying' the property was a sham, because according to the Land Registry they already owned it.    I called a solicitor who said there was a case, and I could instruct for a fixed \\xa3300 fee, but his handling of it was poor. In response to his letters requesting documentation to support their belated claim that they had transferred the property to themselves as executors, my brother and sister just made accusations that I had delayed the winding up of the estate and they would deduct expenses for the property from my legacy, up until they obtained the loan to pay me a year later. The solicitor would give me advice, then when I asked him to write in accordance with his advice, outlining to the executors my rights as a beneficiary, he would say 'We're not really strong on that'. After 5 months I challenged him because my research on the was not supporting the advice he gave, and he had made no progress at all. He passed the letter to a senior partner who basically replied that there was \\xa31500 of unbilled work and if I didn't take the case elsewhere he would charge me for that and would need a further \\xa31500 for the next step. I had asked about costs throughout and had been repeatedly told that I was still covered by the initial payment- so I had to come to the conclusion that my interests were not best served by this firm and would have to proceed alone. The current situation is that the executors sent a cheque in June 2015 for my share of the value as at October 2014 (\\xa317,391) - the solicitor said it would not be prejudicial to my case if I accepted it. My brother and sister retained equal shares of the remaining\\xa3237,605 equity in the property. However, as stated in my first post the executors have taken all of the residual money as costs of the estate and further reduced my specific third share of the \\xa310k by the costs they say have been incurred. I put forward an offer to the executors in June 2015 to settle for \\xa34390 as the remainder of my legacy and a small amount of interest, without sight of the accounts. They did not respond and since seeing the figures they have provided I have withdrawn the offer - because it is now apparent that they have taken money to which they were not entitled. Still more dubious is their use of my mother's bank cards. They had permission to use them for my mother's shopping, until her death but did not advise the banks until October, that she had died in August. I know that my sister continued to withdraw money from the accounts in the intervening period. Since writing for verification of the accounts a month ago, I have heard nothing. I have sent another letter outlining the amount I calculate would be due to me after the legitimate expenses have been deducted, and suggested I would consider a proposal from my brother and sister based on that. Having been stung by an ineffective solicitor already, I am very wary of incurring costs that I would not be able to recover. I'm sorry this is so long, but sometimes an overlooked detail makes a big difference?\",\n",

The owners of this house purchased additional land at the back of their property to park their cars and also are telling me now that they own the pathway linking all our properties. They have placed a large dustbin across this passageway which I think they use for garden waste. It has made access difficult. It is just the otherside of the gate accessing their back garden so doesn't cause any obstruction for them but for everyone else.

The issue is over a recent Will and what I think is a Life Trust in which my partner appears to be named as a beneficiary. This will / Trust was drafted professionally by a reputable Solicitors and to my no legal brain appears to contradict. First let me define what our pre understanding was of the Testators intention. They leave their house on death to be split evenly between two friends with a family member entitle only to Life interest until Death. Sounds simple but we have contacted the solicitor who state when The Life tenant either rejects the gift or dies It will go to the 2nd Beneficiary who can sell it. Here\\'s how the will reads Clause 3 Life interest in xxxxxx <<<address here 3.1.1 \\'The Life tenant\\' shall mean Mr X3.1.3 The \\'Trust Period Shall mean the time between my death and the death of the life tenant.......3.1.4 The Trust fund shall mean my property...... free of any mortgage debt or charges thereon..... with carpets, curtains and other items of household use....not specifically gifted by my will.... 3.6 ....Shall permit the Life tenant to occupy or use rent free......3.7 ..... Subject to the determination of the Trust period the Trustees (Solicitors) shall hold the capital and income of the Trust Fund for Beneficiary Y.... subject to her living at the determination of the Trust Period3.8 If the Gift in clause 3.7 fails then by substitution the Property Trustees shall hold the capital and income of the Trust Fund for Beneficiary Z.... subject to her living at the determination of the Trust Period THEN GOES ON TO SAY....... 4. Definition of my estate4.1 All my property of every kind wherever situate 5. Administration of my Estate5.1 Pay any funeral....5.2 Deal with the remainder (\"my Residuary Estate\" as I now direct. 6. Gift of Residue I give my Residuary Estate to my Mr X absolutely 7.Subsititutional ProvisionsIf the above provisions for the distribution of Estate fail then the following shall apply. Further gift of residueI give my residuary estate to Beneficiary Y and Beneficiary Z as shall survive me and if both in equal shares absolutely. ???? So I\\'m confused Why grant Life tenant to Mr X then later say Residuary Estate absolutelyThen say if fails split 50/50 between Beneficiary Y and Z (my partner) but before indicates only hold capital and income on death of Beneficiary 2 Just  reads stage and when I try to apply logic I go round in circles. It is my understanding the Life Tenant was carried out as the Testator did not wish Mr X to have the house...  Please help my decipher this there\\'s only three people involved I don\\'t understand why it\\'s so confusing! Bits in clause 3 seem to directly contradict Clauses 6&7 mores I don\\'t understand how these two circumstances could arisee.g. two outcomes seem to be proposed when Mr X dies and the solicitor is choosing to give full House to 2nd beneficiary to sell despite it stating that it should be split 50/50 Confused HELP please...',\n",

If it's scrap I make an offer based on a fair price and usually buy it. If the item is resalable I offer a higher price and sell it as second hand. Often I am offered items that are not scrap but are too expensive for me to invest in and put into stock.2 years ago I decided to offer a selling on commission service so that both the customers and my business could benefit from selling these higher priced items that I had previously turned away.The customer is issued with paperwork accurately detailing the items left with me and stating the agreed selling price and my 30% commission fee which is taken from the sale proceeds.This has worked well for me and customers up until now. Following poor sales figures this Christmas in addition to ' a perfect storm ' of circumstances, mostly of my making, my business is now in serious financial trouble and will have to close.Right now I owe various customers approx \\xa35,000 in total from the sale of their goods.

And if they said that we would get paid towards the end of the month it would probably be a week or two later than they said.Obviously, I am fed up with the inconsistency of payments, but I don\\'t think it has anything to do with their client being late with their payments, although this is what they claimed.More likely, it\\'s to do with the fact that their clients will pay money into their business account - which is really a SAVINGS ACCOUNT - so that it\\'s never easy to withdraw money immediately; plus the fact, it\\'s probably in their interest to leave funds in their account for as long as possible to maximise the interest that they earn on their savings account.However, I don\\'t think it\\'s FAIR to pay us later than they\\'ve promised, and I don\\'t think the frequency of payment should be so inconsistent; but I need to know whether the employment law of England/Wales would REGULATE the frequency of such payments.Firstly, I need to know whether there is any LAW against employers not paying their staff on time, and whether the law would require them to pay us on time, and on a REGULAR basis.So any suggestions?',\n",

You state you are self employed so YOU do not have an employer. Everything you say suggests you are engaged in a \"disguised employment\" situation. [Close Quote] Despite the absence of any formal contract of employment do you think I can still take legal action against my \\'employer\\' on the grounds of a \\'verbal contract\\' between us? Verbal contracts are legally binding and theoretically he still owes me \\xa33,770.00. So would it do to print off my timesheet for the period 9th November to 20th December 2015, and get their client - the site manager - to sign it - also, I can photocopy the client\\'s Daily Occurence Logbook, which will show my sign-in and sign-out times, and my daily signature. Provided I can get the site manager on my side I will have a useful witness who can vouch for me in a court of law. She would be able to tell the court that I have worked as a \\'Gatehouse Security Guard\\' during the period specified. So do you think that the aforementioned would be sufficient EVIDENCE of a \\'verbal contract\\', which I could USE to bring legal action against my employer, either at an employment tribunal or a small claims court?  And do I have sufficient Evidence for such a legal action to be successful? NOTE: Since I started working for them I have received 3 irregular payments by BACS, which my bank can easily prove.

It seems as though my exes sister had told police I had sexually touched her 4 years ago. When she would have been under age. I was shocked hurt and most certainly did not do anything of a kind. I didn't know where to turn. Days after this I was still maintaining contact with my boys. Then on my birthday in July 2 weeks after the accusation had been made and I had travelled to Somerset of my own free will to give police all they needed I had a letter from My ex stopping all contact at all. No phone no seeing them not even a happy birthday on birthdays. It effected my health I now suffer severe depression and other health conditions as a result. I recently decided to issue court proceedings myself as I am now out of work due to depression and cannot afford to pay my solicitor. At the first hearing my ex was a bully again, and I felt as if the court listened to her and didn't want to take anything into account. Said that I was a danger to my kids and that she was worried I would hurt them too. I have so much evidence to prove the kids are safe and happy when around me. I came away with only allowed to send birthday and Christmas cards not even presents or a phone call is allowed I feel hard done by and I was open to any contact arrangements just to be able to see my boys. I really don't know what to do anymore and I have not seen my boys for 7 months this is not in their best interest. I want the best for them and to be able to play my part as dad.I will also mention that I am in a new relationship and have been for 6 months. My new partner has three children aged, 3,6 and 8 and I play a massive part in their lives. The eldest has severe ADHD and I am able to handle that no problem. My partner has known about the accusation since the day I heard from the police. I hide nothing as I have done nothing wrong. Please help me. I need to see my boys, I love and miss them so much\",\n",

We've never had a dog, and we have lived 230 miles away from the previous address ever since moving out.

So the woman has obviously opened some mail of ours and used that to run up debts. What I'm unsure about is who's in the wrong here.

I forget what they call it these days but there is also what used to be called a contracts race in which bids for a property in closed envelopes were all opened on a set day and the vendor made his choice.  Next time you could just ask the estate agent to inform you first if a higher offer comes in.  But, by showing such keenness, you risk pushing the price up. As I'm sure you know, properties also get sold at auction where everyone knows what the bids are. EDIT:  Whoops, I've misread the problem but will leave my comments in place in case they help someone.\",\n",

You do not mention what assets your father may have had but assuming he leaves no spouse then in the absence of a will you would be a beneficiary under intestacy. Not only that but you would be allowed to apply for letters of administration (probate). Is there any reason not to contact your half brother? Incidentally it would make a difference to intestacy whether in this case it is your father or your mother that you share.

I received a letter yesterday from a firm of solicitors regarding a balance for a service charge relating to the period 1st January 2013 - 31st December 2013. The demand is dated 24th August 2015. We had just paid the 2015 service change and due to an oversight on our part neglected to pay the one relating to 2013 as we thought it related to the payment that we had just made. We heard nothing more about it but then received the letter from their solicitors along with copies of letters dated 30th September 2015 advising that an admin charge of \\xa3144 would be applied if payment wasn't received and one dated 21st October 2015 advising that an additional \\xa3198 admin charge would be applied and if payment was not received then they would pass the details on to their solicitors.I have been back through my records and found the original service charge demand for \\xa357.33 and discovered our oversight but we had not received anything further. I don't believe this is any kind of defence though? So now I have a bill for \\xa3762.33 which is made up of \\xa3399.33 service/admin charges, \\xa33 disbursements and \\xa3360 legal costs. A little excessive for an original bill of \\xa357.33 which I would have paid no hesitation had I been aware of it.However, due to the now sizeable bill I am faced with I have been looking into it a little more. I have come across Section 20B of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 which states that demand for service charges must be made in writing within 18 months of the charge being incurred. Am I right in thinking I have a case here and that given the charge relates to a period ending 31st December 2013 and the first demand received is dated almost 20 months later I am not liable for this?I would have paid the \\xa357.33 with no hesitation but given this new demand from the solicitors is so extortionate in comparison it would be great to receive any advice on this!Many thanksKate\",\n",

However what I didn\\'t realise at the time is that we are not covered by this as we own the freehold and I believe have no such time cover as the Act only applies to Leasehold properties. I have since dug out my transfer documents - the service charge reconciliation has apportioned 1.235% of the total costs to us but the signed transfer documents state that our proportion is 0.807%. When applying the 0.807% it actually works out that we have paid a \\xa3113 surplus for the year and the chances are we have been overpaying for the 7 years we have lived in the house. I have called their solicitors and spoken to someone who has taken that info and is now requesting the managing agents to send them a copy of the transfer documents.

They are in the process of selling the house, which has grown in value but the equity is likely to be swallowed up in their respective debts and his family\\'s desire to recoup any money put into the relationship. They gifted some of the deposit along with our side of the family. I understand there is evidence of this \"gift\" with the Bank so that is unlikely to stand up in court, but there are various loans both verbal and written to take into account. My daughter has left the house and moved in with a new partner where they are being supported by the council for their rent. She has no income being a full time mum and her ex is still expecting 50% of the mortgage payments from her. He has his own company and this is starting to grow although he has been careful to pay himself the minimum wage and the dividends rarely hit the joint account. The business was partially supported by my daughter\\'s income before the baby arrived along with most of the household bills. My daughter\\'s maternal grandmother has also supported them throughout their time together to the tune of \\xa326500, but it is likely that this would be deemed as gifted since there appears to be no written evidence of an agreement to repay. The evidence comes from her bank account and credit card statements. The obvious route would be to avoid legal entity as this is only going to deplete there equity further but there is so much acrimony getting in the way for them to sit down and discuss things fairly.She is not entitled to legal aid as there was no violence although there certainly was some unpleasant language and emotional abuse used in their exchanges.My daughter is keen that the ex is part of the baby\\'s future and is \"biting the bullet\" to deliver her for weekends with him.

I know only a little about the law (mostly medico-legal, give in whom I currently work for) so apologies if I sound uninformed. I appreciate your counsell and patience. There are going to be redundancies across my organisation's London office in a cost saving measure, with many more positions being moved to our office in the north of the country. My issue comes from being told my roles and duties would be 'shared out' amongst the colleagues in my team who will not be made redundant/moved. I feel this is because, over the past few years, my duties and responsiblities have been trimmed back to the point where I do very little of any consequence (let alone importance or impact) - I have been reduced to being a very junior member of staff and this has been noted by other colleagues (I have worked at my organisation for nearly 10 years). I feel, and have felt for some time, that I was not treated properly by my employer. I don't have all of the full details of my redundancy yet, but from what I have been told, over the phone, the redundancy has been implemented due to my workload being easily shifted to other colleagues. To me, this seems unfair due to what I have described above; as a legal professional, you might think otherwise though.

I contacted the police and they say they cant do anything as he says he is fixing his fence even though the evidence and witness statements can proove that is not the case.He has placed extra long screws throughout the fence so they stick out a good inch over my side and I have cut my arm on this and so has my son.I am looking for any legal advice to where I go from here. I thought the restraining order would have stopped this behaviour. I am getting ill from this constant harrassment and would really like some help. Many thanks.',\n",

As it is it is not possible to gain access to the rear of the barn let alone carry out and repair.What course of action can i take to reinstate the 2m boundry ???I am concerned that without any maintenance possible eventually the corragated iron sheets may corrode to such a extent that they could fall in to the adjasent gardens.Any advice greatly recieved',\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"Hi.In 2013 I bought a first floor flat with Right of Way and a place for a refuse bin. In 2015I needed to sell because of ill health. The sale fell through because it was ascertained I had no Right of Way. Apparently the pathway / alleyway (of longstanding existence) that lead to only 1 property (i.e. mine) had been sold to a local person. He has extended the path to the rear of my property to gain access to another property he has interests in (which originally had no access to the alleyway and therefore no access to the street).Prospective purhasers need paperwork regarding the Right of Way to my property but it seems that the neighbour who bought the alleyway holds all the cards. He has also requested a sum of \\xa310,000 just for the place for the bin.Surely this can't be right. Any advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated asthe conveyancers have been of little help in sorting out this problemdue to the neighbour being unresponsive and unhelpful throughout. I am a widow and a pensioner in poor health and this situation I am finding unbearable.Many thanks.\",\n",

Rights of way as easements transfer with the property. The right of way should have  been registered on the title to both your property and on that of the pathway. I am not sure I understand the geography as you say yours is a first floor property. Is there no other access other than this pathway? Through an  outside door in the building and up some stairs for example. When you reply also detail if you know, how old your flat is, when the alleged transfer of the pathway took place and how many years the pathway has been in use. All these details may be very useful to your case.  The bottom line is that your conveyancers should have ensured there was a legal right of access to your property and if they did not they were negligent.  ',\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u\"Many thanks for your reply and to answer the points you raise in order: Regarding access to the property - the only access to the flat is via the front door which is located along the alleyway leading from the street - the door pertains solely to this property and no other. There is an entranceway leading to a hallway and the remainder of the flat is upstairs. Regarding the age of the flat - this is in a period building (c. 1850s) and the flat itself as far as I know has been in existence for 30-35 years. The pathway is well established between period buildings and has probably been in use for many many years. The transfer of the pathway was done at about the same time as my purchase of the flat towards the end of 2013 but I was not informed of any difficulty at that time. Difficulties arose later when I attempted to sell and I lost my sale because I found out the neighbour had bought the pathway. There has been no problem regarding access to my property, only that I can't sell it and I need to for health reasons as I can no longer manage the stairs without assistance. Kind regards.  \",\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u'I must emphasise that the advice I give is based on the legal situation and not what is happening in practice. If you require to cross land that is owned by someone else to gain entry to your flat then you need either their permission or a Right of Way. This is basic stuff for a conveyancer ( or it should be).  Any competent practitioner would check their client had a legal means of access either across public land which is usually the case or if across private land that there was an easement ( a legal right to cross). Without a right of access you become a trespasser. The conveyancer should have checked the title to ensure a Right of Way was registered. Where a ROW exists it continues to exist even if the servient property ( the land on which the ROW is situated) is sold. this means tha if your property had the ROW the fact that the pathway was sold does not matter. So the first thing that should be checked is the title. If ( and it sounds as if this may be the case) it is not for some reason registered then the issue needs to be tackled or you will never sell. There may be a simple way out and a Right of Way by prescription may have been created. In plain terms this arises if a route is used continuously for twenty years or more openly, without permission, and without force. So if the pathway has been used for twenty years or more and noone has done anything about it there is the likelihood that the Right of Way by prescription has been created. To prove this you have to make statutory declaration to this effect and serve it on the pathway owner. You can use the time previous owners used the pathway hence it seems a racing certainty that if the flat is 30-35 years old it must have been used for twnety continuous years. It may be just a simple error but obviously a solicitor has picked up on the issue and it needs attention. You should initially go back to your conveyancers who acted when you bought the property asnd ask thgem for an explanation. It appears their negligence has led to this.',\n",

The bank records and credit cards clearly show I was the main provider so far the legal bill is about \\xa34.500 . I\\'ve been to the 1st hearing where the judge told us off and to move forward to making offers, my barrister advised me that my pension fund with a transfer value of \\xa354,000 pounds was a potential source of income (myself being 56 my ex being 45 ) of which I could cash in 25% tax free add some money in which I had leftover from the mortgage \\xa311,500 + some cash of my own I should make an offer of \\xa330,000. But my policy holder told me I couldn\\'t cash the 25% in, my pension being in a category that doesn\\'t work that way!! So I went back to my solicitor who said \"we wont make an offer but we\\'ll get the right to buy on the table and offer to relinquish all my rights in that as part settlement\" When we went to court for the second time the judged talked without any regard for the fact the children in the relationship weren\\'t mine saying that the length of the cohabitation made the house community property and threatened that if I or my ex wasn\\'t prepared to negotiate the costs could be assigned to whoever was being the most unreasonable. I made an offer of \\xa322,000 + my car which is worth about \\xa33,000, neither her or her barrister believed that I couldn\\'t get my hands on my pension and said they wouldn\\'t settle for anything less than \\xa332,000 and the car , we went back into the court and the judge was impressed that we had made progress but dismissed to the next hearing ordering me to get up to date valuations on my property and written confirmation from my insurers that the money was not available to me, and that she should get written confirmation from the council as to the cost of the council house - the discount and a separate independent valuation of the property to indicate a true value. He also asked her to get a mortgage proposal to indicate how much money she would need to buy the property, I\\'m almost certain she wont get a mortgage because she has CCJs against her, Its always been her intention to get as much money as she can out of me then buy the property with a mortgage that is backed up by her rich boyfriend who is paying her legal fees, then probably let the property till the 5 year term is up then cash in.

The Financial Dispute Resolution Hearing is in someways a strange process. It is in effect a final attempt to get the parties to reach an agreed solution. The judge willl usually give an indication as to the way he is thinking in an attempt to broker a settlement. Sometimes this is to try and jolt one party from an unrealistic stance. Howver the judge cannot force a settlement and once it moves to a final hearing to all intents the FDRH is old news. There is a different judge and the parties cannot refer to any indication that might have been given. So the new judge is free to go in which direction they feel the evidence dictates.',\n",

He pulled off a job soon after starting the works but was paid a 'settlement' amount for the work carried out by the main contractor which was probably less the costs he had incurred.The reason the judgment is against the defendant personally and not his company is because he paid 2 other workers (his friends) their wages in full and therefore my argument is that by paying them and not us he is personally liable for not treating all of his creditors equally in an insolvency situation.The defendant is now currently self-employed and during an order for questioning provided bank account details (the account only had only a few \\xa3 in it though and is unlikely to have the sufficient funds to cover the debt).  He does own a second property that is solely in his name that he did state during the order for questioning he was being paid rent of \\xa3750 for this property.  I have tried using HCEO's to collect the debt but there has been no response from the defendant.  I am not sure if its possible to have a the Third Party ordered against the tennant in the second property he owns to secure payment that way or if i did go for a charging order what are my chances of getting an Order for Sale if the order is granted.thanks in advance for any help/advice that is provided \",\n",

Got it right down to final figures & precentages last night, so I phoned the Probate Helpline for some last minute advice. They said the figures sounded okay but had I got my IHT reference number? I said no. They said do not send any forms anywhere without this number. So I said, okay, where do I get this number please? They said apply for it online - it takes 7 days to come through. Seven days, why aren't we warned? If I'd known I would have applied for this number two weeks ago. Now a further delay of seven days - seven more days to make finite resources stretch seven days longer :-|  Which leads to my next question. Poor mum's car is gathering dust now in our garage. Can I sell her car - if things get difficult - before probate is granted, and inform HMRC of the sale - as a 'codicil' to the Possessions Schedule please? On top of whatever period of time there may be, these extra seven days - a waste of time - are now obliging me to think along these lines. Another bolt from the blue - could see no mention of it on the IHT400 - was a 'property tax'. What is this please? Whatever it is, it sounds like it's going to be added to the 40% inheritance tax figure? Not impressed. Have followed the IHT400 through all the way only to be told over the phone about all the things I haven't done or made provision for yet - why is this information not on the forms in the first place?

I had the 'DIY LawPack' which I found very useful but what is not useful is the loose leaf arrangement of this publication - so I have the card cover and nothing else remaining now! Doubt I will ever find the loose pages amongst everything else. I found a bank letter template in a Which guide however, so that's all right. Some of the assets are shares, that's not going to be so easy to do.  I need to sell some shares to cover the IHT Property Tax, but would like to transfer the balance to my own ISA. Perhaps if I just write to the Investment company ahead of filling in tranfer forms, they can advise? Many thanks again.    \",\n",

We jointly own 5 properties (joint tenants). He lives in one and we both consider it his, I live in one and we both consider it mine. 3 are let out and I manage those and I think it likely that he would be okay with me taking full equity on them.We are amicable with 3 kids, but I wish to start cutting off the financial ties that bind us. I have heard of equity transfer. Does anyone have any idea of how to proceed, can it be done DIY, must I have a solicitor and most importantly how likely is it that my mortgage lender will agree to my ex husband coming off the title of my house and the buy to lets.

Had this been my fault I would have put it down to experience and moved on however there are a few factors here that I feel entitle me to compensation (in the form of reimbursment).The kerb in question changes direction at an angle of around 30 degrees and continues for around 1.5 metres after the change in direction. Here is the important bit the kerb is only 4-6cm thick is bordered by obviously a road and the other side grass. The grass, weeds etc have been allowed to grow over the kerb completely obscuring it from view unless you stand very close and look straight down at it. I have a witness who saw the kerb and confirms it was obscured due to poor maintenance and I also have several photographs from different angles showing how hard it is to see. I sent all this information along with a polite letter and a copy of my garage bill to the site owners. They have responded by saying that as I said it was hard to see then I should take more care and that I should claim on my insurance for the property which has a \\xa3250 excess. To be honest I would have settled for half the money back and an apology but after such a response it has become something of a matter of principal now. Could anyone advise me of the best way to proceed here.On a side note I mentioned that my young son fell over while playing in a designated play area because gravel from the adjacent walkway had spilled onto the play area. I am not seeking compensation for his minor cuts and bruises but they have not even acknowledged this part of my email and I am keen to get them to properly divide these areas so that other children don't go tumbling the same way.Thanks\",\n",

He lives in Colorado with his daughter and has a business, home whole life. But is happy to move here until we can possibly move over there in the distant future but this is only possible if he can provide for us all here as I am a single mum self employed on a very low income on benefits. So I have lots of questions we are looking to get married in the states when I visit in August as we have been advised that it would be best to get married in the states rather than here as there are less visas and expenses to deal with. Firstly would that be your advice marry here or there? Also can he come here and buy a house with mortgage or outright? Would he be able to come over and work straight away and set up a business to support our family? What do we need to do to make all of this possible?\",\n",

Ive never touched either of these boundaries and have always maintained the land within. In the corner I also have a septic tank that has been there I expect for 60 years plus and has never caused a problem.The land behind my garden wall is being developed to housing. Whilst clearing all that land my wall was damaged and ended up collapsing, I was assured things would be put right when eerything was finished, lots of stone was taken no doubt sold on so the remaining I got someone to put well within my boundary where it could not be touched. The builders continued to use the bottom of my garden to put their equipment and took advantage of my land generally.Recently I came home to find where my wooden fence was, it had been removed and a large digger had dug vast holes within my garden to ultimately set a high fence. They dug up trees, and one hole went stright through my soakway for the septic tank...I confronted the builders and they said the land owner of the field said it was his land and he told them to do it.I requested nothing was done until my surveyor met them on site - however a site meeting was held where the builders and land owner surveyors decided where the boundaries were and we had not been invited.Now I find out that they landowner continues to claim his land is withing my garden at the side and now the builders have said that they will be coming over what was my boundary stone wall into my garden and set a fence there.How can I stop this happening - I have many photos and even the deed plans do not show a big step in at the side. The holes they did are enourmous, I have plants and trees and do not want a garden full oc concrete.',\n",

That company didn't do anything and there were no works or maintenance on the building.We heard through the grapevine but not formally that the property developer who essentially 'owned' the management company had folded, and a majority of flats in the complex had been reposessed by a bank.That the bank was now looking to maintain the property and had appointed a management firm had been appointed to put a management company back in place. We heard this in 2013.We ourselves moved out of the property in 2014, and continued to send emails to an address for the 'new' property developer to find out what was going on - when the new management company would be in place and what the plans were.Prior to 2014 I myself maintained the block our flat was in, including cleaning the communal areas, the doors and dusting/cleaning communal windows etc.Fast forward to 2015, and this property developer who has sent zero paperwork or sent any correspondence to us detailing the situation - has sent a bill on email for \\xa31500 for 'maintenance and ground rent for the past three years - since 2012. The invoice has the name of the new management company, which we can see was started in Feb 2014.Needless to say, we're not too pleased - and would have been happy to have paid monthly - but were not given any details of what the position was.We have communicated to the developer that the bill is unreasonable - and in response they have said that they will have to recover the costs from our building society if we don't pay within seven days!Help...\",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u'We had a tenancy agreement that start back on August 21 2014. The rent meant that there were 6 of us living in a shared house, and per the contract we were all jointly liable to pay a certain amount every month i.e. \\xa3500 for rent x 6 meaning \\xa33,000. I have had massive difficulties with one particular tenant, who has now left the house. Over the period to June, so coming onto 10 months now, he has had serious issues paying for rent and for bills. Whenever I would try and get hold of him (I work away from the house regularly) he wouldn\\'t answer his phone, until we had to confront him to pay. This has meant that over the course of the 10 months, I have covered nearly \\xa31,200 in rent and bills for him. Often what would happen would be, the deadline for rent would come, and I would speak to him, he would tell me that he needed 2-3 days to pay it, and in order to ensure the landlord was paid on time, I would just pay the whole amount. Then he wouldn\\'t make any effort to pay me. This has happened on 2 occasions, other times the total amount including bills might have been say \\xa3600, but he would only pay me \\xa3450. The point is, that he always said he would pay me back but as it got to month 6-7 I started to realise he was not doing anything for himself (i.e. get a job) to make sure he can pay rent. So I said I would stop helping him. He\\'s struggled for a few months by asking other friends and family for money for rent, and it got the point a few days ago where he said he couldn\\'t come up with the money for our latest rent, so we made a decision that he would need to leave, which he accepted and has done so.I have said to him to come and see me so we can sort out the rest of the money he owes but he has decided to ignore my calls and messages. I have access to \\xa3600 of his deposit money which will halve the amount he owes, but I would also like to chase him for the remaining \\xa3600.My questions are as follows:What would be the best course of action to take regarding this situation? I think it is fair to say now, that even though he has been saying he will pay me back all this time, he doesn\\'t have any intention to do so.The other 4 tenants can and will back me up into saying that while the tenancy says that we are jointly liable, we all made a verbal agreement at the start of the tenancy to say we will all pay in equal amounts every month for rent, and for any bills.I have messages from him saying things like \"I have been working very hard to pay you back\" which shows that I didn\\'t just give him the money, and that he would need to pay it back.I appreciate that the small claims court is something that I would need to consider, is there any advice that anyone can give me on how best to prepare for this case, and any key things that I should consider.Any advice would be much appreciated.

Anyway, I took the car to my local mechanic and straight away he pointed out a slight mismatch on the bonnet where it doesn't line up as flush on one side. Also, if you look very closely in the engine bay you can see signs of cracking, the underneath of the bonnet is black and clearly a replacement bonnet. The car is wrapped in white which I obviously knew when purchasing the car but now I can see why it would have been wrapped, to hide damage on the original colour. Also, it is now showing a light on the dash that the drivers door isn't closed when it actually is, and none of the electricals are working on the drivers side. I'm almost certain that the car has had damage to the front right hand side of the car. To top it all off, the engine light has came on (which is under warranty but I'd rather not keep the car).So, I have spoken to the dealers and all they have said is they will fix the faults but to be quite honest I don't feel safe driving the car, I'd rather just get my money back and spend that kind of money on something in better condition. I feel like I've spent too much for what the car is really worth when you consider all of the faults.What are my rights and where do I go from here?Thanks.\",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u'Hello, all, I\\'m new to this forum and have a few questions which I hope someone can help me with.We recently moved out of our rented property after 10 months (after previously being told it would be a long term tenancy) as the owners wanted to move back in. Our deposit was \\xa3825.We received a text one Saturday night informing us that our tennancy would end after one year (this is in around March time so we had until July to find another house). We got worried and contacted the council to see if they could help us find another house. One of the options given to us by them was that we could have legally stayed in the house as they could not evict us legally - We have kids and didn\\'t want to do this. The council then contacted our landlord saying we could take them to court and stay (for some reason). She us after angry and upset, but we assured her that we woudln\\'t do this.We found another place and planned to move in in May and we let the landlord know. From this point on we received a lot of pressue from them. Daily texts about what was happening with our other house, stating that the house had to be immaculate for when they go back, etc.. Few weeks down the line... I did more digging and found out about the tenancy protection schemes. At this point we found out that our landlord was ringing all our neighbours finding out what kind of tennants we had been. Alarm bells started ringing and I had the feeling that this could get nasty.I contacted the three schemes to find they had not used a scheme, but I didn\\'t query this with the landlord as I wanted to see what happened with the handover. We moved out on a Saturday and we had previously agreed that we moved meet on Sunday at 12:00 for the handover. The landlord\\'s husband went round to the house on Saturday night and she text me \"The house is empty, have you moved out?\", we said we had, but we wanted the extra day to clean up the house, etc... she wanted to move in that night... We told her no, as previously agreed, it will be Sunday at 12:00. She demanded that I meet her husband that night, but I couldn\\'t as I was out that evening. It was getting nasty and I left it at that then I received a follow up message from her saying how she didn\\'t appreciate \\'how I had been with her\\' simply because we wanted to hand over the house the next day and finish up tidying the next morning.Sunday came. We got a text late morning saying that it will now be 1pm in the afternoon to hand over the house. We agreed and got someone to look after our kids for another hour. We waited until 13:10 before I text her asking that we were short on time and that the kids were being looked after and how long they would be. We got a response \"we will be there shortly\"... At 13:20 they still hadn\\'t shown up and I text her saying we had to leave to get back to the kids. There was no coutesy informing us that they were going to be late and or an actual time as to when they would show up.About 15 minutes later when we picked up the kids and got home I received calls. Bascially shouting down the phone about the state of the house. Carpets hadn\\'t been hoovered, stains on the blinds, dust on cupboards, etc... The house had been thoroughly cleaned by my parents, my partner\\'s, my sister and aunty and one of my friends. The house was in very good condition. On the phone she demanded that we go back and meet her, I informed her of our situation and that she had failed to show up on time - she then hung up on me. I rang her back. As usual she didn\\'t let me get a word in, but I kept asking what scheme she used for our deposit, she hung up on me again. I sent numerous texts and called her numerous times in regards to the deposit scheme all that day but nothing came back.On monday I text her again. I asked what scheme was being used and that I had contacted the schemes and they have informed me that the deposit was not enlisted with them and I would persue this legally as she had broken the law. My partner\\'s parents received a visit from them. She was moaning at my partners parents whilst her husband told her to be quiet and that they should leave. She then proceeded to bring up the death of their daughter - my partner\\'s dad went mental and told them to leave the property immeadiately. I then called her (she answered this time) saying the police will be called if they step foot on their proerty again. After asking about the scheme she used for our deposit she hung up on me again.Enter the fray my landlord\\'s husband\\'s solicitor. He emailed me On the Wednesday that I was n breach of protocol if I had persued it through the courts without sending an action before letter (I had sent the letter on Tuesday and asked him to ask his client to sign ofr the letter that was being help by the Post Office). I told him the story so far, but didn\\'t receive a resposne. I gave them till June 10th to respond. Yesterday, on the 11th, I emailed his solictor informing him that I had not received a response. I got a reply saying that they had emailed me on the 3rd (I had not received this at all), I asked him to attach the email actually sent, but his secratary was away on leave so couldn\\'t prove that it had been sent.... Anyways. In the email was a letter listing numerous damages to the house and scans of receipts/invoices from various cleaning agencys:\\xa370 for cleaning the cooker - my partner cleaned this thoroughly, but the notes on the scan say that there was embedded food on the hobs, glass door and roof of the oven. \\xa323 for a letter box that was already broken. \\xa3255 for steam cleaning the carpets (I had previously text her saying that I would do this on the Sunday we left the house, but she told us not to) She also promised to steam clean the carpets when we first moved in as the previous tenants had a dog, she also came to the house over Xmas and said she would get it done for us, but again, it never happened. \\xa365 for removing mould in ALL the window seals - We were only there 10 months... There was also mould on the bathroom ceiling and the blinds in there that she said would be sorted on a later date when we moved in - but that never happened. The blinds for the patio door were to be replaced when we moved in as they were heavily stained - we were billed for this too. There were a few damages I was happy to pay for... Adding an additional lock to the bathroom (as there wasn\\'t one on there) and the handle for one of the doors.In total, the letter amounted to \\xa3477.95 in damages (our deposit was \\xa3825), but they were happy to setlle for \\xa3250 in damages so the total I\\'d get back would be \\xa3575. I\\'m not particualy happy about this sum due to the fact the carpets needed steam cleaning anyway, the oven was definitely cleaned to a good standard and I don\\'t see how we can be billed for mould growing in the window seals if we had only been ther 10 months - plus the fact that there was mould in the bathroom and on the blinds.I know I can take them to court to get my full deposit back as they have broken the law (his solictor confirmed in an email that they had not used one, and it was an oversight on his client\\'s part and wasn\\'t done purposely. I could also be entitled to compensation too.What I\\'m not sure on his what happens with the damages? I remember going through an inventory which we signed, but we didn\\'t get a copy of that. The tenancy agreement says that no interest will be incurred on the deposit , but doesn\\'t say where it will be held.If I can them to court, and I win my deposit back plus the fees, can they then counter sue me for the damages to the house? I\\'m sure most of it is exagerated and there\\'s no way we caused that much damage, but they have invoices and receipts. Can they actually take me to court for the damages? If I lose I\\'d then have to pay for court fees, his solicitor fees, etc which will obviously outweigh the amount of my deposit and would probably exceed the 3x compo I might get also.Or do I just accept the settlement - I\\'m not happy to do so, but if it avoids a lot of hassle and court hearings, etc, I\\'d just get it over and done with. But, the landlord has won.Any help will be greatly appreciated. Do I pay for 30 minutes consulation with a solicitor? Will I receive any information from them worthy of \\xa380? I\\'d spoke to the Citezen\\'s advice bureau, but they just direct me to websites...Sorry for the essay. Thank you in advance for your help.',\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u'Hi, im really hoping someone can advise me on a problem that has casued so much stress and financial problems.ill explain the best I can but without rambling on.Due to having a new baby I needed a bigger car and during feb this year I purchased with finance a used car for just under \\xa36000 from a dealer. I was not taken on any fast roads to test drive said car. Immediatley after driving car away it had problems. The car came with a 3 month warrenty andI also purchased an extended 3 year warrenty. The dealer agreed to fix the issues or atleast tried for a while. The issues related to the car vibrating badly, clutch problems and issues with the wheels. The car ended up with 10 faults which involved me taking the car back and forth to the dealer whilst they attempted to repair said problems (15 visits to the dealer in total), and as one of the issues were the wheels and I ended up doing a lot of running around to have wheels and tyres tested for the dealer. After there 3 month warrenty expired I was tired of the car as the problems were still evident and more were appearing including the cv broke on the front left drive shaft. The dealer advised me that the 3 month warrenty had expired and wasnt really interested.I took the matter up with the finance company and told them thatI wanted to reject the car as it clearly wasnt fit for purpase and thatI had given the dealer ample oportunaties to fix the problems. My request to reject the car fell on deaf ears and eventually I was told by the finance comp that the dealer wanted to have the car examined and that I was to now speak again with them even though I had told them I had lost all faith in the car. On contacting the dealer he asked for a list of problems whichI supplied. The dealer then attempted to say that I had never made him aware of any of the problems (although he had replaced 6 parts due to the issues but failed to resolve them) and that even though my 3 month warrenty was up he would offer two ways to deal with it.I explained to the dealer that I had recordedin writing every phone call, visit to dealer and whyincluding dates and what had happened so how could he state that I had not made him aware. The dealernow will only communicate via email and has now offered the following - 1- to go through the list I had of problems and try to sort them or 2 have the vehicle examined by the cars manufactor and then see what they find and then fix any faults. Either wayI would have to leave the car with him (I.E not take the car myself to the examination). I no longer not only trust the car but also the dealer as he now has startedback trackingabout things. Whats to say he doesnt claim he has had the car examined but doesnt and then says there are no issues. I want to reject the car totally as i do not trust it and worry ifI have to take my baby in it. Not onlythat but it costs a lot to constantlydrive to the dealers. I know that ifI reject it totally I cannot use it which again makes life very difficult. I have already had to take time off work for work tobe done to this car and last week i ended up paying \\xa3150 for a new drive shaft as the dealer told me it was not covered anymore but told the finance company that he offered to repair it as a good will gesture. Sorry for the very long essay but as professionals do you thinkI have a good case for rejecting the car under the sale of goods act and what are my chances ifI take the matter to small claims courtbig big thankyou for your timekind regardsJim',\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"Ok i'll give the basic sinario and hope someone can give me some advice  I have been living with my partner for 8 years. I sold my house to move in with my partner. I shared the house with my Son, the house was half mine and half my ex husbands and we had agreed that i stayed there until my Son was 18. My partner and i had agreed neither of wanted to get married, the issue was discussed extensively and he promised me that he wanted me to move in with him and that i would share in his life as an wqual including in the property. Based on this promise i sold my house and spent the money on my partners house and on family things, not at any point did my partner tell me that i shouldn't spend the money as if we did break up i would not have any entitlement to the house or financial help from him. We had a baby and some of the money went on that as i had to give up work due to a very ill prenancy that i had to have hospital treatment for regualrily. I was on contracts before this and surprise surprise it wasn't renewed after i became pregnant. I also had intended to use some of the money from the sale of the house on going back to university. When my daughter was about 6 months old i applied and was offered a place on a pgce teacher training course. I had to give up this chance of a career as my partner said he couldn't afford to pay the mortgage id i didn't work and couldn't afford childcare. I gave it al up and we agreed that i wuld stay at home and bring up the children, work as a childminder in the house and this would free his time to work unsociable shifts as a police officer and do extra work as a fire arms officer which enabled us to pay the mortgage with my wage as a childminder. We agreed i would do this until he retired in 2020 at which point i could go to university as we would get a lump sum to pay the mortgage and he wouldn't be working shifts/fire arms jobs. Before i turned down the place at university to stay at home as a childminder i questioned his intentions on my security. I wanted to get married and if he wouldn't i would leave and take the place at university. He assured me he would write a will, that i was on all the insurance documents if anything happened to him and that i would be treat equally as a wife should anything happen. He said we didn't need a piece of paper as it woudn't make any difference, that i was his equal whether we are married or not.So i stayed. But some years later he has now decided the relationship is over and i have discovered he never wrote a will.So my question is, can he? Given everything i have put towards paying the mortgage and i sold my secure home to move in with him on his promises. Also my job is in the home i have children on my books until Sept 16. My Son is also being assessed for mental health issues. Mt solicitor says i have undoubably got interest in the property.So if he wants me to leave on the 1st September by 4pm and i don't what happens then? Can he have me arrested or does he have to go to court to get an order.PLease helpIdeally i'd like to stay as i don't want to up root my children, this has been his decision, there has been no affairs or violence etc, he's just gone into shut down. He has moved out to his parents at the moment too.Surely things like this went out with the dark ages, throwing your family out and being able to get away with it. I don't want to go to court because of costs so im just trying to sit tight and hope my solicitor is right.Thankyou for any help, greatly appreciated\",\n",

But the Bailiffs won't accept your side of the story, although you have receipts to show you have already paid the Council; but they have advised you to get in touch with the Council to update your account, which should reflect the fact you have already paid the original fixed penalty.So you go by the bailiffs advice and send email to the Council (with receipts attached to prove that you have already paid them) to request they should update your details to reflect the new balance on your account.

If so, would you issue a writ against local authorities at the local county court?Could you sue the Council by way of tort for making FALSE allegations to bailiffs about the 'outstanding balance' on your account; as you have been distressed and aggrieved by such allegations, which has created inconvenient situation of you having to chase the Council to update your account? Could you sue the Council for tortious liability since they have a legal duty to update your account, and information forwarded to bailiffs should reflect the new balance on your account? Such information forwarded to bailiffs (to update your account) should be TRUTHFUL instead of FALSE allegations, which is unlawful, unfair, and WRONG.So could you sue the Council for tortious liability as you are now on the receiving end of a patronizing 'removal notice' by bailiffs, which does not reflect the fact your details should have been updated to reflect the new balance on your account?

Small claims is in effect a court of summary jurisdiction where the judge has a lot of discretion. The process was set up to allow the non legal person an access to justice without having to pay high legal fees. Consequently where the \"spirit\" is complied with and does not cause an actual detriment a judge will almost invariably allow any amendment. I suggest you make your point and enter your defence at the same time -thus you appear to be acting reasonably. The other reason for this approach is very pragmatic and should serve as a warning. In my experience of small claims where both parties are unrepresented technical shortcomings are easily found on both sides. I recently represented someone( I was asked to go literally at the last minute and had no say in the preparation of the case). The claimant started by trying to win on a technical argument that the defence had not complied with certain time limits(true) and therefore certain statements should not be allowed. However I noticed a defect in the claimants procedure and asked the judge to rule that as the claimant wanted technical precision he should receive it - judge agreed and dismissed the claim!

I've come to the conclusion that one possible reason could be that im*gefap (or other similar sites) is losely based on a form of fantasy where comments are clealy intended to be taken as a form finctional converse - it is understood from the outset that comments are not intended to be real or show intent (i.e. not dealing with real news items or real people or situations as is the case on twitter) and perhaps most importantly, absolutely no one in any photo/image is ever named. The whole area of making comments seems very unclear and the fact that people can routinely make excessively offensive (using vulgar sexual terms) comments on these type of sites without a care in the world seems totally bizare to me.....I have never heard of anyone being prosecuted for such comments from these types of sites.Many thanksAlex\",\n",

(For the purpose of talking to me.) They don\\'t seem to care about the law, and keep coming onto my property and trying to ask me questions. No warrant, no suspected crime, none of the special reasons which can grant the police access. They refuse to specify any defence against trespass. Since they\\'re trying to make me answer questions instead of doing whatever I was doing, they are attempting and succeeding in disrupting my activities, so I think this counts as the minor crime of aggravated trespass.I reported the officers through the complaints system once I\\'d recorded them on my laptop webcam. It was classified for local resolution, and quickly abandoned, concluding it hadn\\'t happened (they would only come in if you invited them, the issue of access to the front door was ignored) without asking for evidence.I appealed, amongst other things questioning the use of local resolution and objecting to my evidence not having been asked for or viewed. The appeal result utterly ignored my claims to have evidence, and specified illegal reasons to justify local resolution; that it didn\\'t meet the threshold for IPCC referral and wasn\\'t subject to special requirements, which is contrary to the Police Reform Act 2002. The test required by the law is whether, if it was true, it would justify disciplinary or criminal action, which I think should be true of knowingly and repeatedly committing minor crimes. (And even if I\\'m wrong about it being aggravated trespass, that would still mean the appeal needed to go to the IPCC, instead of being handled by the constabulary.)Further complaints were designated \"local resolution\" then seemingly forgotten, nothing heard since initial recording. They\\'re going to come again soon, still witholding any defence against trespass.So...My plan is to sue the police (the Chief Constable) for trespass in the small claims court. Get damages and an injunction. And then ask the professional standards department why nothing is happening on complaints where the police have been found guilty in court. But...1) Anything obviously wrong with this plan? I think injunctions against trespass are available even in small claims, but I do wonder whether a judge might not want to give the police an injunction preventing them from trying to do their jobs, even if it\\'s clear they\\'re doing it illegally and intend to keep offending.2) What level of damages would I want to ask for? Since there\\'s no property damage, it would seem to start as \"nominal\", but then there are huge aggravating factors, which leaves it really unclear. (I don\\'t really care about getting money, but I want to do it properly, rather than \"letting them off\".)3) I know you\\'re supposed to start off by demanding the damages out of court. But the real goal here is the finding of guilt and the injunction. What does it mean to demand the injunction? Would that be a demand for a solemn promise not to visit again?',\n",

From all the resources I had found on the internet up until this point, it had seemed like the only difference between a police officer doing his duty and a regular person is that there are a load of situations; a warrant, arresting someone or having arrested someone, preventing a breach of the peace etc. where the police just plain don\\'t need permission to enter, because they have a \"justification by law\" or possibly \"necessity\" defence against trespass. \"License\" defences being different would be puzzling, since who you are doesn\\'t affect whether something has been agreed or not. Implied access rights work by giving someone a \"license\" defence, right? Just by having a front door, you invite anyone who comes by to come to the front door and knock on it to enquire as to the availability of anyone in, and hence extend to them a license to do so, unless you specifically state otherwise, and there\\'s no possibility of the visitor being welcome. It seems really surprising that \"I have a front door but you can\\'t come to it\" should still invite some people even while it doesn\\'t invite most. An invitation or license that you\\'re still giving even though you say you\\'re not giving it seems really weird. \"I have a front door\" invites anyone to knock on it, and \"come in\" then invites anyone to enter. We\\'re saying that \"My front door does not invite you\" still invites the police officer but not the TV license inspector, even though \"You can\\'t come in\" then refuses entry to both? What\\'s the difference between the two licenses? What am I misunderstanding here? (Obviously, expecting any policeman to carry round some list of places they weren\\'t invited to knock on the front doors of or anything like that would be totally unreasonable. But that\\'s not the case here.)',\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u'Life works on a lot of unspoken assumptions. If you stuck up a big notice at the edge of your driveway and said \"no visitors allowed on land\" then most categories of potential visitor would be trespassing. However it would not apply to a police officer acting in the execution of his duty. You cannot exclude police or any other persons engaged in law enforcement acting in the execution of their duty if they have statutory powers - the problem being that it may not be possible to tell in advance if they are.',\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u'So, it\\'s not the usual implied right, it\\'s a different construct, which notes that it\\'s usually difficult to know whether an officer has a statutory right to enter before they\\'ve had a chance to tell you why they are there, and so, puts an officer coming to your door somehow outside of the normal rules of trespass, (for common-sense convenience or something?) even in the case where they don\\'t have any statutory powers to do so, and they know this and you can swiftly work this out? And, (extrapolating,) this protection would expire, in that case of not having statutory powers, once this fact had become clear, but unless you\\'ve now told them to go away, they can now remain at least on your doorstep on a \"permission implied by inaction\" basis, due to the absence of an objection? And folks like me who are really bad at face to face confrontation have no effective way to express what permissions they want to give in writing in advance, and have those respected? It all resets once they\\'re here? Interesting interaction of tht concept with the thing where a trespassing officer is automatically not considered to be acting in accordance with their duties, at least in the context of an assault on them not being an assault on a police officer in the course of his duties.',\n",

In those rare cases where a police officer enters premises unlawfully ( most of the cases are about officers entering lawfully but remaining after being asked to leave) they would not be acting in the execution of their duty.

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"Trademarks can be registered with either the Principal or Supplemental Registers maintained by the USPTO. Filing a trademark with the Principal, or primary, Register will grant you national recognition and protect you from infringement throughout the United States. Registering on the Supplemental, or secondary, Register, however, will only protect your mark as far as your common or state law. Nonetheless, holders of marks filed under the Supplemental Register may still sue for trademark infringement, if they so choose. A business also has the opportunity to register a trademark based upon their planned use for it in the future, even if they are not using it in commerce at the time they register. According to Schulte, filing an 'Intent-to-Use' application will keep your mark 'pending until you show you use it.' In order to qualify for 'Intent-to-Use,' a business must plan to use the mark in commerce, and file an Allegation of Use statement, which allows a 30-day opposition period where other businesses may claim that your proposed mark is 'confusingly similar' to their own. If your trademark is deemed unique, your application process will be 'Approved for Publication,' and you will have to wait for a 'Notice of Allowance' to be issued until you can officially use your trademark.While many business owners hire attorneys like Schulte to assist in registering trademarks to ensure that their marks pass the test of uniqueness, he says that businesses have the option of researching themselves, as well. Plus, since the U.S.'s federal system for registering trademarks has become so reliant on the TEAS system, businesses have never had an easier time researching for unique names and designs on their own.\",\n",

As two siblings you are the only beneficiaries. So if you can agree between you the matter is easily resolved. You can make what is known as a deed of variation which in effect means you can split the estate as you decide. As things stand the title deeds of the unregistered property show Adam and Betty as joint tenants. The dates of death mean the property will then pass to Adam absolutely. Unless the matter is argued out in court this is how the property will be dealt with by the Land Registry. You will have to register the property in order to deal with it. If you treat the property as belonging wholly to Adam then you can value it and apply for LOA. The only advantage at this stage in an action to determine if the JT was severed would be if IHT was an issue. Assuming it was not once you have LOA you and Clive can agree the respective % between you. It is possible for a joint tenancy to be severed by conduct but it is not something a court would agree without a deal of evidence. This is one of those situations where the only winners would be lawyers and I repeat you will save yourselves \\xa3thousands by agreeing.

The post-98 Credit Agreement makes it clear in Section 6 that they have to send notice out, but the pre-98 CA is more wooly, merely referring to how they have the right to determine the dates, and from this one can infer that therefore they have an obligation to tell the account holders of their determination.However, they have clearly created a convention of sending these notices to account holders over 25 years, and as there is no obligation to the account holder to request a deferral notice, it just got me wondering about \"convention\" in law and what force it has.Regards, H',\n",

Clearly my son needs a solicitor present.I told him the obvious that if he is arrested say nothing until a solicitor is present but what should he do if he is not actually arrested.Is he still entitled to a solicitor and will one be provided. The police have said if he doesn't go to the police station they will come and pick him up. I take that to mean arrest him.I have to say I have just started work having been out of work since before Christmas and I am absolutelydesperate for cash only just preventing the house being reposessed and and army of bailiffs decending. Hence not wanting to get involved if there is nothing I can add.There are plenty of witnesses, friends of my son, to everything that has been going on. I get the impression that the parent of the other boy has now found out about their son getting thumped and want some action but how much provocation should one boy take especially when being racially abused?Needless to say this is out of charecter for my son.\",\n",

Your best bet is to get an independent solicitor or go to CAB.  If you enter a 'no win, no fee' agreement, you won't have to pay your solicitors' fees if you lose (although you may still have to pay some expenses). If you win, you will have to pay your solicitors' fees and these will be much higher than if you lost your case. You should think very carefully before entering a 'no win, no fee' agreement as, win or lose, you may still have something to pay, and this can often be much higher than expected.  Other expenses You may have to pay other expenses for things like experts' fees, accident report fees, official searches, court fees, and travelling expenses. These expenses may not be included in the 'no win, no fee' agreement, and they can be very high. Hidden costs Before you enter into a 'no win, no fee' agreement, check the terms very carefully for hidden costs. Depending on the circumstances, and the agreement you have with your solicitor, you might have costs to pay if:  your solicitor advises you to drop your case, you refuse to settle out of court when your solicitor advises you to, you agree to settle out of court against the advice of your solicitor, you refuse to co-operate with your solicitor in some other way, the other side is ordered to pay costs but can't afford to. You might also have costs to pay if your solicitor advises you to drop your case, but you carry on with a different solicitor. If you then went on to win your case, you might still have to pay a success fee to your original solicitor. This would be on top of any costs you have to pay to the new solicitor. \",\n",

Its been four weeks, a builder has come round several times and stated until the leaks stopped (its dripping constantly still through 3 light sockets that have been disabled) they can't do anything, once that occurs they wil be able to bring in dehumidifiers and then survey the damage to the ceiling and walls before carrying out repairs.My argument is that its been four weeks, the lounge feels damp constantly, my clothes take forever to dry in there (no where else to have a clothes dryer) and having only 1/4 lights working is just damn irritating. If it had been my own leak, my own insurance would have resolved this within days, isolating the leak, and repairing all damage and bringing in heaters/dehumidifiers straight away. I've had to have heating on when it's not really needed (downstairs have theirs on all the time so heats my flat) just to try dry out the room so it doesn't feel damp. But as the landlord upstairs is doing it cash in hand I feel like I am being screwed over, ideally I'm sure through my own/landlords own insurance I would have been moved out or compensated by not paying rent but I can't really do anything as it stands?Any help would be great.\",\n",

Due to the financial mess that my father left my mother in, she was unable to afford a good divorce solicitor and so the mortgage was never signed over solely into her name, even though her, myself and my brother were the only people living in my house as my father moved out when he left in 98.In 2012, my father was made bankrupt and so the receivers came after his half of the house. The house in question has a mortgage of \\xa380,000 but was valued at \\xa3215,000 leaving \\xa3135,000 equity.Due to the fact that my mother had been constantly maintaining the upkeep of the house, including new bathrooms, kitchen, fittings and fixtures etc, and been the sole payer of the mortgage, my father's stake in the house was valued at \\xa326,000.The receivers want to know the action required within 14 days, but seem to be insinuating that they will force her to sell the house to raise the money.A couple of questions:1) Is my father under any financial obligation to pay this as he is now out of bankruptcy?2) Can they actually force the sale of the house?I have spoken to a friend who practices law but isn't a specialist in this area, and is pretty confident the answer to question 1 is yes, and the answer to question 2 is no, but I wondered if anyone could shed any further light on this?Thanks .\",\n",

Can I assume the debts that resulted in bankruptcy were incurred after he left? I cannot for the life of me see how the  answer to question 1 is yes.

I believe this is linked to what you're referring to in terms of my father being entitled to nothing when it comes to the house.  The debts did indeed occur after the separation - not long before he was made bankrupt in fact.

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u' I want to make it clear that not having detailed access to all the relevant papers and facts makes comprehensive advice difficult. However I will give you an indication based on the facts that you have disclosed as to a course of action that could benefit your mother. There seems to be just two major obstacles but in effect they amount to the same. Firstly I gather your father is still on the legal title. Secondly the receivers are after what they claim is his share. As there is \\xa326000 at stake she will need to spend some money on trying to defend her situation. It should not be very expensive but it is unlikely she would be able to deal with it without legal assistance if a court hearing was required. I suggest you approach the receivers and see if they will cooperate with the suggested course of action. This is to seek a declaration from the court (Part 8 procedure) as to whether your father had any beneficial interest in the property at the date of his bankruptcy. If nothing else it is a strong bargaining position as I think it likely the court would find in her favour if there are no significant facts omitted. The very fact that you are indicating you will go down this route may persuade the receivers to back off. Part 8 is what is known as an alternative procedure and is used when (unlike most court cases ) there is no dispute of fact. In your situation there are unlikely to be any factual disputes. It seems in effect your father deserted your mother in 1998 and made no further financial contribution to the property. These facts are not in dispute. In other words  by his actions he appears to have abandoned any interest or obligation in it. So the legal question is: does he have any remaining beneficial interest in the property. The law of equity would almost certainly find that in those circumstances he could not simply come back years later and try to claim an interest. As the only ground the receivers have is entirely dependent upon him having a beneficial interest, if a court decides he did not then their claim would also fail. This is not a matter of mathematics , the court will decide on the basis of equity ( fairness). Should a man who walks out on his family be able to return after 14 years and still claim a financial interest when he has made no contribution since leaving.  The answer is almost certainly no.',\n",

Yet it charges \\xa340 for a single journey.The terms of the 24-hour return are clearly laid out (well, as clearly laid out as Ts and Cs tend to be) and they state:\"\"This they have duly done - I used the 24-hour return, did not return and the ferry company have charged my account \\xa318. Fair enough - I have broken the Terms and Conditions.However, my argument is that by not returning the ferry company has not lost anything. In fact, they have gained an economy in their fuel consumption, reduced the wear and tear on their ferry, have not had to employ anyone to load and unload me and haven\\'t had to pay for anyone to check my documentation.So I have two questions....1. Bearing in mind the company has suffered no loss, are they entitled to enforce the contract and charge me the \\xa318?2. Is the term as laid out by the company an Unfair one (in the legal sense)?I guess one of the reasons they offer the day-trip return rate is that they\\'re hoping that someone will buy something on-board on the return journey.

Although I'm pretty sure I'm looking back through rose tinted glasses, the same as you - even Tony Hancock used to mock BR for being dirty and unreliable! In terms of the ferry, you're right to mention the opportunity cost and, if travel companies were not able to over-book their seats (i.e. I pay for a particular seat on the way out and on the way back and that's it - the company cannot sell that seat again), I'd agree with you.  However, these companies don't operate in that way - if I'm early, I can usually just get the next ferry (within limits and provided there's space on that ferry).  Conversely, it has happened where I've been booked on a ferry but it's been too busy and so I've been bumped to the next one. Bearing in mind the companies do operate in this way, what I've done by not turning up for the return leg is provided the ferry company to fill that space with a paying customer.  The one and only single opportunity cost I can see is that they were hoping to sell me something onboard (in the shop or the cafes or the bureaux).  However, since this definitely wasn't made clear in the Ts & Cs, this cannot form part of the contract. As I've said, I definitely broke that particular Term in the contract between us.  My point is that the Term is an Unfair one because it basically says that if the customer takes less of a service from the provider than was agreed (and has paid for), this will result in a higher payment being due.  And so, because of the lack of a consequential loss, I believe this cannot constitue a legal Term.  And really I wanted to get an opinion on that. Power to the people!\",\n",

Just to add there is nothing in our employee contracts / handbook regarding me dating an employee so even if i was which i have not been i have done nothing wrong.So what should i do? there wont be any evidence of me falsifying timesheets or late forms so im very very confident they wont take any action after the meeting but i dont feel it should have got this far and i feel the fact i am being singled out as unfair so would like to take things further regardless of the outcome of the investigation.\",\n",

I decided to move to my parents with our daughter for a month until I managed to find a property to rent.He stated that he wanted to continue to live at the property as he said he could pay for the mortgage on his own as he had a good job so I decided to let him have the property and I would get my name taken off the mortgage. In the meantime he did not pay the mortgage so when it came to me wanting to take my name off the mortgage company advised that I had to wait until he had paid the arrears. I then found out (recently) that he had moved tenants in to the property and was getting cash in hand off them each month and was still not paying the mortgage (the mortgage company were not aware of this). I had also had numerous summons to court about non payment of council tax to which I had to shame him to pay.Any way, recently he informed me about all this and the reason being was because the tenants had decided to move out and he panicked beause he could not pay the mortgage payments. I said that i did not want anything to do with this as I wanted to get rid of the property years ago. Hes not paid a penny off the mrtgage for months and we have both called the mortgage company and gave them income/expenditure. The mortgage company have confirmed that we both cannot afford the mortgage so they said that they would put it to hardship but now said that they cannot do that because none of us live at the property.I have a new partner and a further child so cannot move back in.Does anyone have any advice on what to do?

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"Hello. I am new to this site I have no had any exposure to the legal world before. I recently resigned a Directorship/50% Partnership due to personality clashes with my then Business Partner.We both had extremely loose agreements (none) regarding business and personal expenses, and indeed shares/dividends payments.During my first year in the post of Shareholder, I was underpaid by around \\xa31700 - this was flagged up by the Accountant who informed us that both shareholders should receive equal salary/dividends. As the business at that time was not particularly profitable, the Accountant agreed to consolidate the above amount against spending on my Business Credit Card - mostly cash withdrawals, retail purchases and IT related requirements.Being the part owner of the firm, I believed in my right to use the card for anything deemed necessary for myself around continuining to carry out my duties, I used the cash for travel, required office purchases as well as miscellaneous purchases for myself at the Pharmacy and my vehicle, which broke down at one point.There was no discerible paper trail relating to any of the cash withdrawals, and we did not have any usage policies of the cards in place, and nothing signed. There were also no receipts relating to the majority of the cash withdrawals.When I resigned, and cancelled the Director Agreement and left the business, nothing was mentioned regarding the card, and/or any loans within the business by the Accountant.Yesterday I received a letter from the Accountant demanding that all transactions that were 'unexplained' would need repaying by myself, into that company within 6 months, and on a monthly set amount basis. I have not yet responded to this letter.Does anyone have any idea legal/not whether I can be pursued for this money, or indeed whether there are timescales I should adhere to with payment. The firm's year accounts will shortly be produced, I have not yet agreed any Director Loan amounts.The Accountants we used (including book keeping) have mentioned nothing to me about this until now.Would appreciate any help!Alex.\",\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u\"Thanks for the comment. It is indeed a messy situation that I wish I'd never got myself into. In terms of why there was no papertrail, it was just errors in judgment on my part and because a lot of the time I withdrew cash to make certain purchases or to balance out costs I'd incurred myself during the job, for example, during the first year, I continued to pay my phone bill - used for business - via my own bank with no papertrail. Last year, the accountant got in touch to say that I had been underpaid by about \\xa31200-1500 in 2013 and my business partner had taken more money than me over the course of time, he said it would be ok to file cash withdrawal transactions made on the credit card (without withdrawal receipts) to absorb/balance off that underpayment rather than take the full amount out in one.  However, it looks as though, the proposed repayment does not take this into consideration. I think the situation is 3 of those, and 2 dozen of the other - my overall standpoint though is that the whole process of working in this business cost me money, and the credit card usage should in most ways cover off money that I believe is owed to me, and compensation for resigning and handing my share back for no reward after 2 years of effort contributing to it's profit. I've since taken free legal advice, the Solicitor basically suggested the best thing to do was to sort it out without solicitors, and come to an arrangement.  I'm thinking too that my ex business partner would probably not want the hassle of court costs etc etc, when things arent clear cut.\",\n",

A friend of mine has been working via Tupe regulations for a number of years as she works for employment training / provider services the nature of which is that the services bid and the best bid wins resulting in staff then being Tupe'd over as I'm sure most of you guys and girls will know how it works. Anyway my friends company recently lost the new contract and untill today was being told they where all being tupe over to the new service so obviously along with others did not see the need to look for new employment. However today she has been told that she along with a number of other staff are surplus to requirements and as such is being made redundant. Her current employers have told them however that when the contract finishes on the 5th March 2015 to go to the new providers on the 6th March 2015 and if they are then turned away they can go for unfair dismissal under the Tupe Law. Is this correct and how does that work???? Cheers Bill\",\n",

Let me explain.Recently there was an issue where as a passenger in my own car a group of people where watching us traveling towards them. They left it to the last moment and walked out purposly causing the driver to make a sudden stop resulting in injury to myself and two children under 4 years old. The driver rightly asked wht the hell they where playing at with both babies sat ibn the back of the car crying hysterically. One began to be verbally abusive and attempted an assault by spitting towards the open window of the drivers. This resulted me jumping out of the car and a heated verble confrontaion ensued. When I got back in the car the one I was arguing with who turned out to be a young mouthy lad was taking pictures of the car.Jump forwards a few weeks the driver gets a call from the police asking if they could go and see her? They asked who the passenger was? If the car was hers as they got her details of an add on the back of the car and so had no idea if she had any knowledge. She was confused untill they mentiond the altercation with the youth she only realised when they told her an accusation had been made against the passenger I.E. myself. They then asked her what had happened so she freely gave a statement of event stating that at no time did she witness me assault anyone.They then tell her they need to speak with me and hear my side of the story.I get a visit inviting me to a formal interview tomorrow now here's my problem and question.I am fully aware that this interview is not about me showing my inocence but a tool for the police to build and present a case to the CPS.The police had no idea that the female was driving the car they didn't even have details of the car except an advert number which they phoned that advert could have been on a number of cars however they then gave here confidential information IE the accusation.They also asked her what had happened so now they have a statement from a witness I would have called actually vindicating me.So as they say anything I say can and will be used against me so answering any questions tomorow would efectively make me a third party I cannot give a full personal statement of events as it has already been corrupted by my daughters statement.The police obviously didn't take a formal statement off her so can deny the conversation however I cannot now give a 1st party statement.All I can do is explain what I am aware of and give the statement through my daughters eyes as why would I be a witness against myself when the police already have a full true statement I am not going to give the police anything they can twist.Aside from the obvious failure of confidentiality which has corrupted the polices case.

It is perfectly permissible to inform a witness of the general nature of an enquiry. How else is the witness to narrow things down to relevant matters. And of course you can give what you describe as a 1st party statement by which I assume you mean eye witness. Firstly the  statement given by your daughter is of limited value in that whilst it may place you at the scene it does not support the case for assault. If they did not take a formal statement from her then what she said is essentially worthless as far as the police is concerned. There is no cause for the police to deny the statement as they would not be using your daughter as a witness anyway. She cannot be compelled to make a written statement.

Perhaps you should stop reading his text messages - and/or tell him not to show them to you or mention them to you - if he is not going to do anything about them.

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u\"It's logical and practical to any family practitioner. One of the things we do is not to look solely at the legal side, but also to look at practical, and pragmatic, solutions to fraught situations. You're the new partner - your ex is reluctant to report his ex to the police and refuses to make a statement.  He is making the best decision for his ongoing relationship with his ex and with his children (i.e. he is putting their needs above yours), so since you can't control that, you have to remove yourself from the situation. One presumes you do not wish to remove yourself from your relationship with him, so your option is to remove yourself from the messages themselves. They are not 'coming into your home', they are going to his phone and his phone is in your house, and you do not have to read his messages and you can tell him not to talk to you about them or show them to you.  Her messages are to HIM, not to you.  You're feeling harassed because HE is showing them to you, not her.  As David gave you the legal position in his answer on your double post on the other forum, you know that there is a legal issue involved - BUT - the police aren't going to act unless your partner makes a statement.  You can try forcing them to act, but I'm not sure that'll be great for the health of your relationship. As advised, the criminal route is not the one your partner wants to go down (quite rightly too as who wants to criminalise the other parent of their children) - but it is also in his power to tell her to stop it, or take out an NMO. Practical solutions (like the one you claim to have made by getting a phone where she can be blocked) are the better solutions in family matters than criminal proceedings.\",\n",

I spotted the signs of inevitable sickness coming on so promptly ordered a taxi. When we got back to the hotel she went crazy saying she wanted to end it all and locked herself in the hotel room. I then heard glasses smashing behind the door and all sorts of destruction going on in the room. Luckily I found the porter to let me into the room and I found her in a corner curled up in a ball.We took her downstairs and sat her on a seat in the empty bar with a bottle of water in an effort for her to come to her sense as little. All calmed down, so the porter and hotel staff left us alone in the closed bar and we talked for a while. I then got up and went to the toilet. When I came back from the toilet she had climbed over the bar somehow and helped herself to another bottle of wine (basically stole it). I took the wine off her and she went crazy saying that if I didn\\'t give her the wine back, then she would scream the place down. I refused so she started to scream \"help help somebody help me I\\'m being attacked!\"Obviously complete nonsense but the hotel staff called the Police (don\\'t forget at this stage our room was wrecked and the incident has been going on for an hour) and we were both arrested and taken to the station for questioning.Luckily there was a CCTV camera in the bar with sound that had captured everything. Or nothing as the case was, so they let me go a few hours later and advised me (off the record) to find somebody new, as they know from experience that people who do thing like this (i.e. basically unstable) don\\'t just do it once \\u2013 it can happen over and over.So as you can imagine, I left her and never returned. It was the single most bizarre experience of my life.Fast forward 4 years and I\\'m driving through Liverpool and get randomly stopped in my car due to my left headlight not working. Luckily I had a replacement in my glove box, however the Police office while checking my insurance etc.. Asked if I had ever been in trouble with the Police before.

I did nothing wrong and was released and even apologised to hours after it happened, so why is it still there? Especially him being able to access it so easily due to a faulty headlight.Fast forward another 2 years, so 7 since the \"incident\" in total, and I have an interview with a local school to work in there IT section. As per usual they will request a background check on any person they deem suitable for position.

Although myself and my ex speak, there is a lot of animosity between us due to the children being bombarded with negativity about me. Thankfully, so far, it has not affected my realtionship with the children.Anyway, the call was fine and I feel we made progress and for the most part managed to agree on a few things that may be very productive.However, after the call ended I hung up and for the first time ever, I was victim to 'pocket dialling'. Basically my iPhone screen did not lock and recalled the last person (my ex). At this point the phone was in my pocket and I was relaying details of the previous call to my long term partner (some of which refered to legal comments/arguments etc with regards to a future case). Some comments may not have been very positive.... but I did speak about some legal issues and concerns I had.When I next pulled my phone out of my pocket some 19 minutes later, I could see the 'green bar' at the top highlighting an active call. I tried to talk into the phone to get the atention of my ex but I could hear some fumbling and then the phone being put down (typicall beep beep beep sound).I realised immediately that the entire conversation with my partner had been being listened too.My question is, do people think that this crosses a legal line with regards to being 'illegal', 'snooping'etc?I fully understand that it was 'my phone' that called the other party however it has to be said that at some point a 'conscious decision' had to have been made to continue listening in and for that reason, without sounding biased, I feel that the actions became illegal at that point.I have been told by my eldest that she had became aware at the time that her mom (my ex) had been listening in to a call and thay she had kept telling them (my children)to ' go away' and be quiet.Although not exactly the same, to find something in the street and make a conscious decision not to return/report it becomes 'theft by finding' at the time the decision is made to retain the item/goods.It should take between 10 - 30 seconds to be fully aware the call was not a live or intended call.... perhaps a minute at the most.Illegal?

I am trying to put the damage right!Now, given that I have responded directly to their solicitor, am I liable for their cost in using one to contact me or is my time in responding equably chargeable?I.E.

       " {'1.Init_Post': u'According to: \"Everybody has a right to choose with whom he will contract and no-one is obliged without his consent to accept the liability of a person other than him with whom he made his contract. Consequently the burden of a contract cannot in principle be transferred without the consent of the other party, so as to discharge the original contractor. As Sir R. Collins M.R. said in Tolhurst v Associated Cement Manufacturers Ltd [1902] 2 KB 660, 668: \\'Neither at law or in equity could the burden of a contract be shifted off the shoulders of a contractor on to those of another without the consent of the contractee.\\'\" ((paragraph 19-077)Chitty on Contracts).However in Jones v Link financial , it was ruled that for Consumer Credit agreements both rights and duties are \"passed\" to the assignee. I have searched Goode and still found no definite answer (although he says theres a drafting error) to my question, so I will ask here:The CCA 1974 gives special powers for an assignor to transfer his obligations to the assignee without the consent or the borrower (creating a carbon copy). However, nothing I have read confirms whether or not the assignor is actually discharged from his original burden after the assignment. One view is that (even after legal assignment by notice) until such time as the borrower agrees, the assignor remains joint and severally liable (along with the assignee) for the duties/obligations. My idea is illustrated here (not uk law):Is there any case or evidence where a legal assignor under the CCA was sued by a debtor for failing to perform?Could someone please explain why the assignor is discharged without the borrowers consent?It seems to be accepted practice that the assignor under s.82A CCA 1974 can discharge himself by assigning away his liabilities. He could assign all his burdens to a bogus assignee as a way to get off the hook. I seems unfair to the borrower so I do not understand. The question may rest on the true meaning of the word \"pass\" in the description of creditor in s.189 CCA 1974.I think the word \"pass\" does not preclude a duplication of duties, but I would really like an expert opinion as I got no reply in the advice thread.Many thanks',\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"   To whoever it may concern, I am in search of legal advice regarding three major issues, two are very similar. These issues have now caused myself, 17 year old girlfriend and 18 year old flatmate a lot of grief and hassle and I would love to be to have all three sorted lawfully and hopefully then continue with my life and education. If anyone could comment with any suitable advice, I would be more than appreciative!1st - We are currently under a section 21 for no other reason than we do not have a guarantor (had to pay 6 months up front) and the maintenance costs of recent breakages including our boiler, a radiator and the bathroom basin taps. We were told that if we came to an agreement with the landlady we could stay and she was very friendly and fine with the fact we had no guarantor in person but now doubts our capability of paying rent even whilst we've proven we have more than enough of an income including benefits. We know for a fact that a member of Belvoir! (our housing agency) was \\u2018referencing' parts of our emails to her and this would not have put us in the best light but was not in complete context. We have had these maintenance issues for months now and because of it, I have denied all viewings whilst we are still here but now they're claiming they can sue for loss of earnings and keep continuously telling us we are meant to allow viewings (of course I know this but considering the tenancy condition decided otherwise). We would really like to stay and only have a month left with no other options for housing, our time here has affected our health due to mould and dampness as well as our sleep as the boiler now \\u2018roars' at well over 85db for periods up to 5 minutes. Does anyone have any advice that may put us in a better position or know of anything that may help boost the landlady's confidence, regarding our rent payment? Oh, I have just found out that Belvoir! has been holding all rent, so the landlady and agency employees believe we owe \\xa31050, which we have already paid previously.2nd \\u2013 My flatmate now lives with me as her previous boyfriend was not only physically abusive both sexually and violently but also very manipulative and mentally disempowering. Although we have had 8 or so months with no incident or communication, he is now skulking around our area trying to find out where we live claiming stupidly embarrassing things along the lines of \\u2018I have people tracing your IP, I have people following you, I know where you live etc.' Previous to the 8 months he attacked me in public and stalked us like crazy, claiming he's going to ruin our live. Of course, now he's back we're worried about hiding our address and he's literally skulking our street and local store. What is it I should have done?3rd \\u2013 This one is slightly more extreme than the previous, an uncle of my girlfriends suffers from severe brain damage, bless him, but is sending constant abuse to family and stated several times that he's given people at the hostel my girlfriend's Mum's address and that they would attack her and everyone inside (which includes a child). We have let the hostel no to no prevail, he continuously sends abusive messages and has even noted something to do with an \\u2018Islamic threat', of course we take everything said with a pinch of salt but still a concern right? He is most definitely in need of a safe haven and professional help but we have no idea how to proceed? Currently ignoring these messages and threats as well as letting the police know, is doing nothing to help us and the grief from all three of these issues is becoming too much.  I know my questions are vague and I will return to add more content when asked for, I am looking for the most professional and efficient process of eliminating these life problems. I understand the tenancy is up for speculation but the second two issues are serious enough that we feel the need to hide inside our property for days on end. Thanks, we appreciate any help.\",\n",

She wanted confidence we'd pay and we want a chance to prove that to her but Belvoir! constantly get in the way. We are in the landlord's best interest, we do pay rent, we keep the property clean and we know full well this is all she's looking for. Her concern is due to the fact that according to Belvoir!, we have paid no rent (whilst we have and can prove that) and have no way to prove our income (obviously wrong). The property may be affecting our health but our next option is the street, there are very few hostel spaces let alone that they are not suitable for two young females and the council will not be able to rehome us immedietly. We have no family between us and no other options. With regards to this, we would prefer to stay at the property and eventually have the maintenance and health issues fixed.  It may also be important to note that I have gone without a fully working boiler, radiator or bathroom basin taps for almost 9 months now, even whilst reporting them reguarly since the beginning of the tenancy. We are within reason to deny viewings, this has been confirmed and there is nothing the LL can do about it. We are sure it has affected her decision but at the end of the day a decision to extend our tenancy would render viewings redundant and we are denying on a completely seperate issue.  Our last attempt now is to send a letter to the LL with proof of our income and evidence that late payments were not our fault but due to miscommunication between ourselves and Belvoir and then between the council and jobcentre. We have apologised for any inconvenience several times but will continue to stay as long as possible, what with no issue between us and paying rent and looking after the property. The LL is not looking to regain the property but re-let it.   As for the ex' and uncle, we have, several times, to no prevail. \",\n",

       " {'1.Init_Post': u\"Hello i have written a very long statement as it as all happened in the past few days and will refer to someone as James. He is 24 years old and started at a coffee shop as a supervisor and was made manager within 2 months of being there. He has received insufficient management training, and recently been dismissed after 19 months due to something he was not trained on or made aware of by the owner or HR manager after 17 months! Is this an unfair dismissal? I will write a small brief below;A year ago James was put in charge of tips which continuously went missing in the work place. James asked the owner if he could look after these tips out of the premises he said yes, he also informed the HR manager, we went out for a xmas party at the end of last year and no issues were raised. In January they asked James what is happening with this years tips, he told them that he will look after them again at home, they said that was fine. They asked AGAIN about 6 months ago and said that it was fine. They both asked James on both occasions, and didn't dispute it.The day before James's holiday (3 weeks ago), Wendy (HR manager) asked if he could bring the tips in, James said that was no problem. She was slowly trying to take his job as James simply didn't have the time or as much knowledge about management as she did. James returned from his 10 day holiday and forgot about tips for nearly a week, and was reminded by Wendy, he apologized and continuously asked when she is next in, so then he could ensure the tips went directly to her. On Thursday 6th November he brought the tips straight into work as he was continuously being pestered for them by now. To his luck, she was in. He handed them straight over to her, and said that there should be \\xa3200 and there was. While he finished apologising and was about to leave, they asked for a log. James was confused as to what they meant by a log, and they suddenly kicked off having a go at him as to why no log was kept on how much tips was made every day. They also mentioned that team members are constantly asking them about tips, and don't trust him. This was new to him as he had got along with every team member very well, not one person had asked him about tips since the owner and Wendy last asked 6 months ago. He questioned why the team members who were asking about tips were not sent his way, the owner and Wendy both replied saying that they were. But they didn't take it upon themselves to inform James about it, and them team members didn't go to him with their query at all. He also explained to Wendy and the owner, that those team members who didn't know he was in charge of the tips either;a) Did not turn up to team members. Team meetings were used as a way of building up trust and friendship upon the team as well as regular updates on how the business was performing, customer feedback and training. Tips were also mentioned in every meeting, so the team members who are questioning Wendy and the owner had not attended these team meetings which were on a 1-2 month basis.b) The team members were obviously not informed regarding the tips during their induction which Wendy was now in charge of. When James was in charge of everyone else's inductions they were informed of tips being put into the jar and not their pocket and that James handles them, and give updates on a monthly basis in the meetings. This was obviously not being mentioned with Wendy doing the teams inductions now.James had now been dismissed for simply not having a log of how much tips they made everyday.He has not been dismissed for taking cash out of the premises as he had both the owners permission and the HR managers permission. But he has been dismissed for Gross Misconduct for simply not making a log on a day to day basis. Something he was unaware he had to do. James was not trained appropriately as a manager that this had to be done, this is his first ever managers role. It was not brought up the previous times that they inquired about the tips. To him this feels very unfair, he has had no disciplinary or any way of appealing.Has he been victimized with this being seen as the only way to push him out of the company?Should he of received sufficient training covering this?Is this an unfair dismissal simply for not making a log?After going through his contract nothing can be seen about taking Cash off of the premises OR anything about tips. Infact nothing about logs is in the contract at all!He is aware tips need to be taxed which is declared at the end of the year as a whole.Any help on this would be greatRegards\",\n",

So the first thing is to determine what the ROW allows. If you can specifically determine its width then so much the better.  A ROW is restricted to its limits and no more. So if eg you could show the ROW was 2m wide he could not bring anything above 2m (even 1cm would be trespass) in width along it. so yes you are absolutely right in saying that he is restricted to the exact ROW and no \"wriggle\" room. It is well established that you can use land right up to the boundary of a ROW. Anything that does not interfere with the ROW is none of his business. As to the water butt you have every right to put it on the ROW if it is a temporary measure. Remember it is your land and he only has the right of passage.

So, what you MUST do, is ensure that you have a solicitor who has specific, and specialised, knowledge of defending benefit fraud cases, and you MUST ensure that the solicitor attends your interview under caution. Your husband should look at providing you with proof of his accommodation elsewhere - though he'll struggle to do that if he never bothered, in 16 years, to take up a tenancy somewhere of his own. You've got an uphill struggle ahead of you - and no amount of forum assistance is going to be enough - so GET A SOLICITOR.

I\\'ll outline as much detail as I can below - if I\\'ve missed anything please just askThe case relates to a claim being made against my partner (JD) who is a self employed plasterer , and myself, for poor workmanship. The claimant , a customer of ours who JD did lots of work for in Dec 2013, now claims the work is sub standard and will costs \\xa32000 to correct. He has refused JD permission to revisit or re-inspect the alledged problem areas in the house and submitted his claim via MCOL. This is the timeline so far -10/3/14 - MCOL recvd from claimant. Subsequently allocated to small claims track28/4/14 - our directiosn questionnaire submitted to court requesting mediation. Claimant refuses mediation27/5/14 - court confirms case is suitabel for mediation & advises of hearing date on 11th AugustNo evidence or detailed papers received from claimant during interim period7/8/14 - 2 working days prior to hearing court confirms to us that cliamnat has NOT submitted any papers. If he arrives in court the case will be dismissed. We decide to submit an N244 to dismiss case ourselves as neither court nor ourselves have received claimant file. We live in France and choose not to travel to court11/8/14 - hearing date. Nothing heard from court until after hearing. Turns out the court made an error and the claimant HAD submitted his papers but they had recorded it incorrectly on the system, hence the direction they were giving us. District Judge rules for an adjournment to allow claimant to send us papers.11/8/14 - claimant emails to confirm our French address.28/8/14 - court order received advising of second hearing on 24/96/9/14 - claimant\\'s papers finally received, 25 days after the first hearing & 13 working days before 2nd hearing.12/9/14 - our defence pack is posted back. we rush to collate it to ensure timelines are met. we are left with very little time to properly respond and organise return trip to the UK. we choose to include a letter requesting the court hear our side in our absence as we cannot afford the return costs or organise our family situation to enable us to travel24/9/14 - 2nd hearing. Judge finds in favour of claimant.29/9/14 - on advice from court, we submit N244 to set aside the order17/10/14 - email received from court advising that the original order issued was incomplete and a whole 2nd page was missing. It rpovided reasons for the judge\\'s decision which we had not seen before now. revised version of the original order issued 17/10. Direction from court is that we have to apply for permission to appeal in the appellant court/circuit court and submitt a further form and fee.20/10/14 - deadline for payment of original order. claimant contacts us for payment.20/10/14 - second complaint raised with court over another miscommunication which has caused further distress and confusion. they advise that the pay deadline of the original order still stands (i.e. the first one issued in Sept even though half of it was missing and it took 4 weeks for them to realise & reissue)Our first issue is that the Court itself has caused significant delay and confusion on this case just by their own administrative errors and miscommunications.Our seconnd issue is that we regret not making the trip to attend the original hearing in person as we strongly believe the claimant\\'s case was quite flimsy but that the judge took his side more as he was there in person and we were not. Hence we\\'re wanting to go down the appeal road and try and get in front of the judge in person.Specific technical queries -i) claimant alledges lots of poor plastering work done by JD. But refused to allow JD the opportunity to revisit the house and assess for himself and/or rectify.(contrary to Supply of Goods and services Act) The Claimant submitted no photographic evidence of poor plastering on walls/ceilings.Just a \"statement\" from a managing director of a building firm (not a plasterer) who stated he thought it would cost \\xa3x to correct. The statement wasn\\'t even in the correct format as required by the court. We submitted a number of our own photos of the rooms in question which clearly showed a clean job but these seem to have been ignored by the courtii) we have emails from the claimant, received before the job was completed, saying how pleased he was with JD and his work and that he would be happy to leave a review online for him. these were submitted in defenceiii) JD has loads of genuine, positive on-line customer reviews on sites like Rated People. These were submitted in defence but overlooked. The point being that he is not a \"cowboy\" builder. If the allegations of his work were true then surely he wuld never be able to sustain the high level of feedback over a 12 month periodiv) The claim was made against both JD and myself as co-defendants. This was because I referred to myself in emails to the claimant as JD\\'s \"business partner\" in that I manage all his paperwork, communications and admin. It was a metaphorical term and not factually the case, JD is self employed & his business is registered with HMRC as a \"trading as\", not a legal partnership. We rejected that I was personally involved as (a) I never attented the property (b) am not a plasterer and did no work at the house & (c) the business is a sole trader not a partnership - but this was rejected also ??The judges comments were as follows -\"found against both defendants. whilst it was denied that the 2nd defendant was a business partner of the 1st she in fact held herself out as having such a status in correspondence. Therefore both jointly and severely liable\"...how can that be when his business is structured as a sole trader. All I did was handle his emails for him!Judge \" Under rule 27.9 took in to account the defendants evidence in their defence but ultimately assessed the evidence of the claimant who attended> i found him to be truthful and credible> therfore claimant succeeds on balance of probabilities\"If anyone out there can add any comments we\\'d be extremely grateful. At the moment we\\'re at the stage of considering the appeal application to try and get in front of the judge ourselves or...appointing a solictor in the UK to represent us as we feel that they would be able to undermine much of what has been presented by the claimant. i think it was our error of judgement in not attending the hearing as we were unable to question or challenge/counter challenge specific points in the papers and it is doubtful that the judge will have absorbed all of our pack on our behalf',\n",

Its probably worth mentioning at this stage that the property is sold and is in the process of being dealt with by the solicitors.The problem we have is that the other executor wants to make an interim payment to the beneficiaries from the cash assets leaving a small amount to pay the solicitor and estate agents fees, but I do not agree with that course of action at this stage.My reason is that when my mother and father purchased the property (early 2000\\'s) they did not have any structural surveys conducted and I would prefer to wait until the surveys are complete just in case they find anything wrong with the property which we need to get rectified and if the money has been paid out then myself and the other executor would be responsible for find the cash to put things right.There are threats from some of the beneficiaries about claiming for \"loss of interest\" on any monies they think they should have had my now and that I am not dealing with the estate properly.Am I being a little too over cautious or am I within my rights to withhold an interim payment at this stage?',\n",

We have spent MANY years (decades) getting to the stage where people, (men, women and children), who have been abused or assaulted, feel that they can speak up, and get the perpetrators punished for their actions, even when such actions are historical. It often takes guts and determination for people to stand up and say 'this person assaulted me', and for you to sympathise with the perpetrator (not alleged anymore) is horrendous, particularly since you think that 'he was only doing what every other man was doing'...not every man. Most men were keeping their hands to themselves and not letching after people who wouldn't have touched them with a barge pole, or were too young and naive to be able to defend themselves against men who held power and were able to wield that power over others to make them keep their mouths shut over what was happening. Lechery is not 'entirely normal', back then, now, or back in the 1800s...people did not like it whenever it happened, but men in power were able to get away with it. Now, they can't. That's something to be celebrated, not denigrated with a catch all (and manifestly incorrect and unjust) statement that implies 'every other man' was doing the same thing.  That is not a justification for wrong-doing...and for that to come from a woman is an even bigger tragedy. Don't justify people's poor behaviour. 40+ years ago, homosexuality was a crime - 60+ years ago men were marrying girls barely in puberty (and in some countries in the world, still do!) - these things were not right, just because they appeared to be 'legal', or because 'lots' were doing it.  They were wrong, they are wrong, and they will remain wrong. Just like this sexual perpetrator who now, rightfully, has a conviction against him for his offence. That he lost money fighting his case is just. If he's 'broken', like David says, he's putting a bloody good front on it. Still trying to blame everyone else for his poor behaviour.\",\n",

Secondly, if you want to run a business, learn as much about said business before you embark on it, otherwise you find yourself in silly situations that you are no longer in control of. To answer your question: you'll need to take legal action to get your tenant out of the property. She is no longer under a tenancy agreement as it is over, but she has a new tenancy - a statutory periodic one.   If you change the locks, you are performing an illegal eviction, for which your tenant can sue you and be awarded damages for. As well as being able to get back into the property - and you'll have costs arising out of that too. If you served correct notice, you can now proceed to making a claim for possession. My strongest suggestion would be that you do not do this yourself, but instruct a solicitor so that you are sure everything has been done correctly - otherwise you will find yourself another several months down the line without your property back. You're in breach of the contract with your new tenant - I'd suggest you give them their deposit back and hope they don't sue you if they were relying on your saying the property would be available for them.

However during negotiations between myself and him, the issue of waste disposal has arisen.The landowner has an empty section of land with nothing but wild grass growing on it. Hence there is no electric, water, ghas or sanitation facilities.I am about to propose using a setup similar to a composting toilet but the hummus or decomposing matter is not below the toilet in a ditch but uses a standard toilet to flush fecal and waste matter towards a composting heap adajcent to the toilet a fair distance away. This is obviously not the status quo method of waste disposal but it is a tried, tested and safe way to do so.The reason why I am here on a legal forum is because I do not know if there would be any legal objections from such organisations as the borough councils or the environmental agency. I wouild appreciate any help given to methanks :)',\n",

I was in alot of pain and couldnt move. Christina then grabbed me and pushed me onto the floor in the kitchen. Christinaleft me on the floor and went into the sitting room and took her children.\"MY COUSINS VERSION:\"Suddenlychristina grabbed hold of her mum yvoone around the shoulder area, she then appeared to push yvonne. The force of this caused yvonne to fall into the radiator in the hallway, with Christina appearing to stumble slightly forward so that she was stood over her. Yvonne stood back up and christina appeared to raise her hands again. Fearing that yvonne may be assaulting again. I grabbed hold of christina by the arms and pushed her towards the front door. Christina pushed me back, so that she could get to the livingroom to get her children. All the children were screaming and crying.\"I dont understandwhy it has gone to court???The trial date is28th October and I will bebe pleading self defence and will have my 8 year oldsdaughters statement to support this.

The actual financial losses were easy enough to do. The damage to health and appearance are really difficult.As I am on disability benefits I cannot afford legal fees, and legal aid doesn't seem to cover this sort of thing. In fact, my case seems to fall through the cracks of established leagl cases (or maybe I just haven't been looking in the right places).Any help or advice would be very much appreciated, as my life as I knew it has been destroyed by what has happened to me.Thank you.\",\n",

You've tried to find a lawyer without success.  A no win no fee basis would be your only legal route in my view. Have you looked into non-legal ways of putting things right, in particular what you call the botched assessment for disability benefits. You will also need to simplify your case.\",\n",

       "   {'a.Discussion_Post': u\"Hi,   Thanks for the reponse.    I think the title of my post is a little misleading (comes of trying to get the main point across in so few words). I'm actually submitting my case for maladministration direct to the DWP, rather than suing. The case is not expected to go to court.   I've had a welfare lawyer help me put the presentation together, but it's trying to find out about the amounts to ask for for damage to health, appearance, mental health, etc. Personal injury lawyers will only give advice if there's something in it for them, and this case is not a straighfoward PI claim. It's more subjective, rather than a simple cause and effect accident or medical negligence claim. I'm sailing in fairly unchartered waters, I think - hence the lack of help out there. There's no way to simplify it, either, as the maladministration was sustained over a period of 2 years and took various forms via multiple departments - including the notorious Atos.   Does that make any more sense?\",\n",

I have worked for the same company for 10 years but left for a few months therefore have only been in a new contract for 6 years 7 months.My boss had a very frank chat with me and has asked me to leave the company and ask to voluntary redundancy. The reason being is that he thinks I am now unchallenged in the role and he can also pay someone far less to do the same job. He is right and I have been unhappy there for a while. He has suggested that he pays me for 4 months and then offers statutory redundancy which works out to be \\xa32750 tax free. I can decide whether to work or not or alternatively go on gardening leave. He has asked that in exchange for this that I sign a compromise agreement. I guess this is to protect him from me taking him to a tribunal. I asked what the alternative was to taking the voluntary redundancy and he said that in effect he could just manage me out of the company and therefore dismiss me eventually.I am quite happy to leave but I am unsure whether I am doing the right thing accepting this agreement or whether I should push him for more money if I could potentially take him to a tribunal.Any responses would be greatly received as I have to sign off the deal in the next few days.Thank you in advance.',\n",

I won the case and enforce judgement against him and he was ordered to pay the full amount. However everytime he gets information through the door or the bailiff on two occasions he has denied all knowledge and just says not know at this address! I know he is still trading at the address under the same name as items are still for sale on his ebay account And at that address. I have recently had the final letter from the bailiff stating that he was informed the person no longer lives at the address and I have to provide info on his new address or the warrant will be filed. How does that work if he just keeps on refusing to own up and tells the courts he no longer lives there?should the bailiff not be able to work out by searching the premises or doing a proper search of documents at the property? I am %100 certain that the individual still lives and works at the address the courts have, however I am now stuck and do not know where to go from here, and what makes it worse is it's been going on for nearly a year and I am now serving a 5 month tour in Afghanistan so everything has to be via email or have my partner try and source info, any help would be greatly appreciated.Kind RegardsDan\",\n",
