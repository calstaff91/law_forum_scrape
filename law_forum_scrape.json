However I feel that claiming that it was due to the internal procedure which was 5 weeks before this request is unreasonable. Surely the solicitor only receiving the claim 1 week before the response date is the responsibility of the respondent.?

To say it is complex at this point should not be a surprise.Is there any way I can convey my views (I am self representing) to the judge without appearing unwilling to ensure due process is followed.I feel strongly that I should not be put out by this as I have a serious mental health problem which deteriorates at this time of year, which will limit my capacity to carry on with the process.

The woman from the couple began to say she was going to hit my friend which I asked her to just sit down and leave it.

While this happened the original man who caused the argument began to seriously assault my friend to which her partner ended up fighting with him to stop it.I went back to the woman apologised and asked to shake hands they swore at me and threw me into the window so I went outside. Once the pizza shop door was closed she began coming to the window goulding me and then my friend saying she was going to kill us and taking the mick out of her tracheotomy and calling me fat we did argue back.

Honey also has high capability to resistbacteria that evolved their immune systems against standard medications.Honey, in the old and modern era, has always been used as a natural medicine for many diseases. This new study might be a new twist to use honey for medical purposes.According to the study that has been done through Sidney University in Australia, Dekarter, a scientific teacher in the biological and microbial science college says, \"our research has shown that honey can replace many of the antibiotics that are used to treat cuts such as ointments and different creams. Also, using honey for healing purposes will increase the aging period of antibiotics. \"She also adds:\" most of the bacteria that cause infections in hospitals are at least resistance to one type of antibiotic, which means the need to produce new and stronger antibiotics that are able to execute bacteria that cause diseases. \"Honey is a complicated compound that is consists of 800 molecules. This complication makes it difficult for scientists to fully understand the honey's mechanism of resisting and killing the bacteria. scientist Dekarter says: \"until now, we have not found the method the honey apply to resist bacteria, but most likely there is the molecule\" Methylglyoxal \", which is part of the honey, that reacts with other molecules which we have not discovered yet , to become able to inhibit bacteria from multiplying and making new generations that have the ability to resist to antibiotics. \"Doctor Rose Koper, from the Health Science college of Wells University, has conducted a research regarding honey's activity against bacteria, and she wrote the book \"Honey facing cuts\".

I received a call today saying that the fee charged on this invoice for the check in inventory was \u00a350 less than the company had charged the estate agent. surely, I am not now obligated to pay the addition \u00a350 as this was not on the invoice I was given. Can the estate agents demand payment of \u00a350 for their own error? thanks. "}, {"2.Time_Posted": "18/07/17 14:48", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "he can plead guilty or not guilty.

I am self employed and work as a GP locum. One of the NHS areas in which I work has decided to make all of their locums \"employed\" to avoid issues with the taxman. When I take up a locum job, I agree a fee with the practice in question. I then am paid gross, and pay tax etc via self assessment.With the switch the employee status, I am now paid via PAYE. However the employer has deducted tax and both employers and employees NI. Their explanation....that I am paid a contracted rate and they need to make all of the necessary deductions from this, and I get whats left. So they have taken off \u00a3300 to pay employers NI.We were told about this change by a practice manager in March. I never received any official letter re this, although the practice manager got one, and has now passed it to me. I therefore didn't agree to the changes, or the deduction, and certainly didn't sign anything. The letter says \"we need to deduct employment tax and NI\" not specifying which.I also did the work at the end of March and the payment was made in May, so the work was done under the old rules and the payment made under the new rules, but again it did say in the letter I didn't see until today, that all payments made after April would be made under the new system \"regardless of when the work was done\". Can they do this?

I got my colleague to remove all client's work, files and computer work from his offices. I made him co-director of our joint limited company to make him feel he had got a stake in this business. The client's work was way behind and piling up. My co-director got a friend of his in to help bring tax returns right up to date and the pair of them soon got all work up to date while I sat back and did nothing. My boss had taken \u00a330,000 plus in advance fees off clients so in the first 7 months we paid expenses and freelance fees and nothing for ourselves. Then when work was being done on time by my hard-working co-director I took the opportunity to put my mobile calls and motor expenses, for this business and my other businesses, through this one business as well as taking \u00a31,500 per month whilst I paid my co-director \u00a31,250 per month for his wages and all the office expenses. I was lapping it up, he did all the work and I sat back and lived a easy luxurious life; it was easy because I had found a mug. Then 8 months down the line he came out with an humginger, that we should both stop drawing from the business to make the Balance Sheet stronger; while he took nothing for three months I took my \u00a31,500 and his \u00a31,250 per month and he didn't know about it because I had sole control over the bank account. After he noticed this, whilst doing our VAT, he then asked for \u00a31,500 for himself but I only paid him \u00a31,250 and he accepted it; I was on a winner and it was a pleasure to see him and his new wife struggling financially to make ends meet. In 2007 he said he wanted to sell up the business and his house to move elsewhere but I just hoped he would forget about it for the status quo to remain. In September 2007 he told me he had had talks to sell our business without my knowledge and I felt that I had my trust in him shattered but we moved on. Eventually I reluctantly offered to buy his share for \u00a325,000 being \u00a315,000 down,\u00a35,000 3 months later and \u00a35,000 a year later. After our partnership had ended I got him to do work for me to keep the hand over smooth before the new mug came in. I paid him for the first month but then noticed irregularities so when I paid him these wages and second instalment I immediately put a stop on both cheques and put the matter in police hands. He had taken \u00a315,000 out of our limited company prior to signing the contract and that was going to be the money I was going to use for the first instalment. After this the second mug worked for me for about 6 months but then just phoned me to say he had won the national lottery so I attempted to keep the work up to date myself even though I had no idea what I was doing. Then in 2009 another mug accountant came along and I made him co-director and I then was back to my same old ways again watching him do all the work whilst I sat back to enjoy the benefits, he left in 2012 and unfortunately he sued me and I had to pay him out and he then had the audacity to take some of my clients with him. My first co-director was then charged in September 2011, in Crown Court, with fraud and I was hoping to see him go to prison. I had already had him struck off as a chartered accountant and I was hoping that he would die in prison or in poverty when he came out. Somehow he managed to bend the rules to get off with a suspended and the fraudster only paid me back \u00a310,000 and I don't no how he got away with that because I wanted \u00a325,000 off him. In January 2014 he then took me to court for the two instalments of \u00a35,000 each plus a VAT bill he said he had paid, I took with me the Detective Sergeant in the fraud case as my legal representative and it ended up in deadlock. I then employed a solicitor to defend my case because I only felt it right that he should pay me more money, unfortunately I ended up with a \u00a310,000 solicitors bill and had to pay the mug \u00a35,000. In March 2014 when I paid him the \u00a35,000 I found out his wife had died suddenly, well that was poetic justice. I have since been trying to get my ex co-director done for harassment, by the police, for contacting my clients in attempt to get them back; don't no how he dares and I just hope that he dies in poverty. By the way I haven't told you that I am a Roman Catholic and have been brought up since I was a boy as a Christian. I still live a christian life but business comes outside of that and it doesn't concern God what I do in that respect."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "02/07/17 07:07", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/ex-girl-love-91-7568793397-vashikaran-specialist-baba-ji-meerut", "1.Init_Post": "Mohini shidhi love vashikaran ke mahir guru baba ji love affair problems Vashikaran Specialist In IndiaWhen there is no work, the solution is to solve your every problem 100% solution by love spell, love marriage, freedom of love, rid of the enemy, vashikaran, marriage, interruption, husband-wife dispuct, love, etc. Love Premvivah, celebrating Ruthaprimi, convance parents for marriage, lovers of vowship, beloved husband, husband-wife, freedom from Sotan enemy, resolved all the problems of your life.

Through this they worked out I was under 18 when I created the account, and as such they are saying they will permanently limit (essentially closing) my account. I spoke to one of their people on the phone yesterday that told me \"I have manually moved the money from your PayPal account into your bank account ending in ****. This will take 72 hours though I will put in a special request for this to be done sooner\".  I phoned up again this morning to check if indeed payment would take place prior to the usual 72 hour point. At this point I was told that the gentleman that had made the promise was wrong, and he had no power to do this.  PayPal are now saying they will be keeping my money for 180 days, for buyer protection. I'm 19, I run my own business (though this is all a personal matter) so \u00a3800+ is a LOT of money to me.

Secondly, with regards to the phone call yesterday in which I was told the funds had been moved across (and would take 72 hours to show in my bank account), does this amount to a contract (because I certainly ended the call confident I would have the money in my bank account in a few days' time).And as a bit of a side note, can they really keep the money for 180 days? and will they have to pay interest on the amount.

I will try and explain this better as i know it was a bit vague. It all began when my dad was taken ill (mental illness).He owned a farm and i had run the farm for 30 years as my own and always expected that it would be mine. I spent a fortune on the everyday maintainance and putting buildings etc on the farm. However, my sister who kept 2 horses at the farm became very friendly with my dad to the point where he spoke to nearly no one else, they stood outside her stables everyday and i could hear them making degrading remarks and poking fun at my mum and  and it got to the point where he turned against my mum and i know my sister was the one manipulating him, she took control of all his day to day finances which my mother had taken care of for 50 years, he was even convinced my mum was poisoning him. Anyhow, when he became ill we approached my sister as we had a fair idea she knew what was in his will, she said he had left one farm to her and one to me. For months after this her and i discussed this at length and she told me that i had nothing to worry about that i had farmed the land and that i would get what ever was left to her, all she wanted was her stables, paddock and grazing rights for four horses. Infact there was a family meeting at another of my sisters houses one night and she went round and asked all of my other syblings if they inherited any land would they be prepared to give it to me as she would be giving anything she inherited to me and that i should get the land as i had looked after and invested in the land for the past 30 years. Any how after my dad died and the will was read it turned out that he had left one farm to her util her 70th year and then it went to her son and one farm to me until my 70th year and it then also went to her son.Now the farm he had left to her was in his name only but the farm he left to me was in joint names with my mum which meant the farm went to her by survivorship and she kindly transfered it to me. So i had a decision to make as to whether to challenge the will or not so i met with my sister who i should point out i was on very good terms with and trusted totally. Anyway she told me that i had nothing to worry about, all she wanted  was her stables etc and that i would be taken care of that they would do the right thing. I then met with her and her son and we decided what i was to get but by this time things had changed and they now were keeping a large chunk of land and more buildings. The problem i had was that the boundaries between the two farms fell through the middle of the buildings i use for my main enterprise but they said there was no problem it would all be sorted. So this sister and another sister of mine were the executors of dads will and they went to the solicitors to sort out the details. My sister who had inherited the farm told my other sister not to worry about the boundaries and that the land should be changed exactly as the will stated and that she would sort it out when she was giving me the piece of land that i required from her. Some months later nothing she had transfered nothing to me and i approached her and her son to ask what was happening and they announced that they could do nothing for at least 6 years as they wanted to pass a building site and they needed to keep all the buildings etc to help with planning permission. I said that that would'nt be any good as i had to make a significant investment in my business and that i need the buildings as security for the loans. so they went off and spoke to their architect who said that it should'nt be a problem and they agreed to transfer me what i required. So i went ahead and approached the bank and they agreed to lend me the money and this portion of land was to be part of the security. So more months passed and still nothing happened and i approached them again but everytime we got near an agreement they moved the goal post and would never sign until i did something more or gave something else up. The last thing was she said she wouldnt sign until we had our own electrical supply installed. Now we had agreed that i would bring a cable through their land to get my supply which would have cost about \u00a31500 but they then said under no circumstance would that be happening and i had to bring it a much longer distance at a cost of 8k but even after this she still would not sign. Now they want to take more land out of the agreement plus buildings but all this is part of what i am relying on as security against my borrowings and my bank are now asking why this has not all been sorted.

He also offered me the chance to sign any interest over to his children without any money being exchanged.I asked a solicitor for advice and he wrote a letter to my brother explaining that any offer would have to be in accordance with the deed of trust, not an amount which was substantially less or without any consideration at all.Needless to say that was the last time I heard from my brother.My question is, would there be any way that the land registry could lodge a note that I have an interest/deed of trust outstanding in the property so that they would notify me when it is sold, or so that the buyer would know that I have an outstanding interest in the property?i am not sure that there is much I can do about him letting the property and not paying me a share of the rent, but I would like to think I would get some inheritance when it is sold.Many thanks"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "15/05/17 19:46", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/letter-threatning-eviction", "1.Init_Post": "innovember 24th 2016i recieved a letter threatening eviction if i did not complete a un-concreted drive12m + by 4m also pointed around coble sets (border of the drive) , a new foot path for access to a gas meter, and lawns or stone chippings on the rest of the garden. with stipulations as to planning permision and severn trent about drains.to top this fraudent letter of permission to do this work (housing association) property.the dead line was january 9TH 2017this deadline came and went and new and different dates the latest is whit weekend.I am now close to completion.my question is can they still use the original letterabout possesion. and do i have grounds against them for the allagation of fraudas it not true."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "15/05/17 12:14", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/definition-contract-value", "1.Init_Post": "I own a flat in a building managed by a management company.Inourexistingcontract with the management company, it is stated that they charge \"12% of contract value for Major Works\".We are in the process of undertaking Major Works and have found a contractor whose quote we are happy with etc.For sake of simplicity, let's say the Builder (contractor) has quoted \u00a3100k for the work plus VAT.The management company believes they can base their 12% charge on \u00a3120k, and so chargethe leaseholders\u00a314,400 plus VAT.

Mediation is a requirement of issuing a C100 application (subject to statutory exceptions) so your son is perfectly entitled to proceed. If the ex partner refuses he will be able to get a certificate from the mediator to say that he attended and she refused. This will enable him to make his application. Read Section 14 on the C100 form - you will see there is a box for the mediator to tick where the applicant only attends.

The police have now spoken to his ex and she as openingly admitted to the police officer who spoke to her that she did not see my son throw stones at her home.(this according to police officers who spoke to my son was the basis of the PIN)  My son and I strongly beleive that the allegation made was vexaious and simply made to cause great distress to my son, The police keep informing my son it is a civil matter which this is what i beleive to be true in relation to care and parental responsibility of his son but not the reporting of the voilent act carried by his ex against my son. Is their any action or request we can put to the police to have this PIN revoked following his ex admitting to the police officer she did not see him , my son thinks his ex is attempting to create a senarior which makes my son out to be a bully and a thug and it appears she is abusing her position as a special constable by involving the police so it will create more distress to my son and to try and collate fabricated evidence of my sons character when he attends to court ensure his own sons right and enforced if she refuses mediation. Can you confirm any complaint of violence as to be looked at seriously by the police. they do appear to take his ex partner complaints seriuosly and act upon them but his complaint as just being brushed aside and he as being told she could put a counter allegation again if he wanted to carry on.

My son does not like to contact the police but he is in fear of a further alleagation being made by his ex so he could possiblily lose his job and income so he cannot fight for his son through the courts etc. The situation does seem to of escalated since he as refused to pay money to her father and his ex partner, she as informed him pay up or do not see your son, I must point out that they both agreed for my son to meet any needs as and when it is required and he would be more than happy to let someone independant decide on the level of funding he would need to pay once equal parental responsibility is agreed. any advice again greatly appreciated sorry for any grammer mistakes.", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "02/12/15 19:23"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "Firstly the issue of money has nothing to do with contact with the child.

The delay last monday was unforseen and out of my control, yet you and your daughter still break prior agreements made, As a father all i can do is appeal to your maternal instincts and ask you again to allow my father to collect Noah from Dani tomorrow at 9:30 am and will return him as normal just after tea, this will leave Dani free to collect Ethan from school as that is the agreement in place, I was informed by my father that during a telephone conversation you agreed that it would be best all concerned that we find a amicable solution , and preventing Noah from seeing his father is not amecable or this is doing is in my eyes adding fuel to the fire. But more importantly it is taking your frustrations out on my child.I will follow the police advice as instructed if my father cannot pick up noah at 9.30 tomorrow morning, and if you wish to terminate the prior agreements that are in place between me seeing noah, then any agreements between me you and Danielle will be nil and void, I am more than happy to let the independant governing body deal with the child access aspect of this dreadful situation you and Dani insist upon following through.I am no longer playing your childish game. to me it is quite simple we have to be adults and be respectful to each other as i am , skull duggery and childishness will not hold any weight when we do finally mediate.

My son was not telephoned by his solcitor but did receive and email which i had to check as his telephone was not allowing him access to email so he was unaware of the request from either his solicitor or his ex partner. and if he had received the request he would of not of change the court order as it was set because they could not come to an agreement in relation to the child and was happy to see the 8 weeks as instructed by the court. My son is livid that his own solicitor failed to contact him when he was fully aware of the threatening behaviour of his partners father in the past. my son would not agree to changing a court order without first finding out why it should be done ( if she was ill or it was impossible for her to attend etc then obviously some other arrangement would of had to be made) this was not the case she was fully aware of the the court order and what day the child had to be handed over by her she was there with her own solcictor who insisted that no third parties be present at the hand over and the court agreed to it. Am i correct in thinking that any court order in relational to child access cannot be change without first contacting the court and should a solicitor be able to amend the order on behalf of his client to suit the needs of the respondant. i personally think he should seek an alternative solcictor as he failed to get any confirmation from my son and in my eyes he should of informed his partner he has not had a response from my son and the court order should be followed.. apologise for the rant but if we have to result to the courts for guidance and directions surely they should be followed otherwise what is the point of gong to court.

Can my son apply to court to have contact with the elder brother of his son so he may have both children stay with him to, he did live with the elder son from being 22 months old prior to his getting pregnant with my grandson so the elder son is well familiar his brothers father (my son) He was brought up and cared for by my son jointly with his mum for more then 3 years until they split up. I would like to know if my son applied to the court to add the elder brother to the current child application would the court allow it. and if so how would we go about it and would it stop the current pending trail.

He hand delivered all documnets to be inserted into the court bundle to his expartners solicitor, he obtained a receipt for this. As far as the social worker goes she submitted a sworn statement to the court which at a prior court hearing my son made the court aware that he had evidence to show it was misleading to the court and that judge agreed with my son that her statement was somewhat contradictive of the evidence provided by a third party. (SS states she attend and observed child being disrupted and being voilent towards other children) My son wrote to the establishment manager who the SS named would confirm this to be true, and he received a reply stating SS have never attended and observed his child nor as the child being disruptive or violent towards any child or adult, they further express that the childs behaviour was age appropreiate and the only concerns that they had was who said they had reported this as it was not true. My son produce this reply to the judge who asked the SS to explain when and how see observed this when the establishment clearly states you have never attended. her reply was somewhat fumbled and she lay blame to the ex partner.The judge informed the SS to attend the final hearing as she would be questioned over her statement made as he had serious concerns of such a statement being made to the court when she clearly known it not to be fact. You may ask why would the SS worker acted the way she did and why would she not be professional prior to the court hearing.  At the early part of the investigation to a large bruise found of the child , the SS worker was charged by the police to carry out a full investigation, and evidence which come to light proved that the ex partner was not being truthful and the bruise was either a accident while in the care of his mum or other adult. Further information showed that it could of being cleared up with CCTV footage but the SS refused to look into it. she further made a number of procedural mistakes which my son and his solicitor at the time made her aware of . Resulting in a child protection meeting being cancelled because of a serious error by the SS worker. Apparantly she was repremanded by her superiors and then it was a down hill struggle to speak or meet with her. Again all this information was contained in documents which was both sent to the ex partners solicitor and the courts.Along with other evidence showing and proving his ex partner fabricated a number of allegations against him resulting in a Police pin being issued and he not being able to attend her address to collect his son for contact etc.He made numerous request for police to look at the situation equally they refused. once the first pin expired she set about having another one issed against him and again he was issued a pin , but because he could prove without a doubt he had done nothing wrong and on this occassion took the evidence to the police , they called him later and informed him the pin had being revoked as she had no evidence to back up her allegations. Again my son informed the SS worker and her reply was \" not interested you have done it \" but yet she still refused to come and look at what had actually took place. So she was taking his ex partner at her word and did not offer to discuss or actually investigate anything. I am happy to say i have scrapped up some money for my son to go see if anything can be done with a recommended solicitor. i will let you know what they advise. I appreciate your advice , but as you can imagine my frustration on the whole situation. My son as follwed all courts orders she just does what she likes and nothing is done. I always thought that the uk justice system would see what the truth was but in our case the truth as being ignored. Sorry for the rant but thats the situation and she is still using the child as a way to punish my son for him not getting back with her and like you said using him as a bargaining chip.

I'm emailing to request advice about my student housing situation. I privately rent a student house and have experienced an array of issues such as electricity problems and damp, but from the beginning of October 2016 there has been a pest problem which I believe the landlord was aware of due to multiple mouse traps in the house. I emailed my landlord to get the situation and he stated that he would send someone over who bought in plug in mouse repellent and then said that if it is our fault we will have to pay but the repellent did not work and I am still experiencing issues which I have told them about. I was also given mouse poison which is only supposed to be used by licensed professionals as the pest control man told me yesterday. I told the landlord that the issue is that there is an infestation under the floorboards which enter through to my room and every night I am woken up by the noise of mice in my room and under the floorboards scratching which has caused me to miss university and the stress has increased my anxiety issues. On the 5/4/17 there was a pest control guy sent in who confirmed that we have a \"large infestation\" and he put in poison however the dangerous poison I have already is still in my room as he was not licensed to remove this. The pest control is coming back in a fortnight apparently but I do not believe I can stay in this house any longer as I have been finding mice in my clothes and underwear drawers and I feel like this could be harmful to my health. I moved out multiple times as I could not stay in my room and I did not pay rent for the months that I had to leave however the landlord is demanding that the house is 100% habitable and if I don't like it then I should just leave despite me studying here. I would like to know whether I can get some form of inspection and if I am eligible for compensation/rent refund to be looked into as the issue has not been sorted since the beginning of my tenancy and I strongly believe the landlord was aware of this issue but is taking advantage of my urgency. On the 8/4/17 I received an angry and intimidating email stating that I was being ridiculous and lied about pest control stating there was a 'moderate mice problem' which he did not say at all. He also asked which part of my living situation I am unhappy about as there is no need for me to be and threatened me with solicitors for missing two months rent due to me not staying in my room for the upcoming week.

We are unable to agree on spousal maintenance as she wants to impose a nominal amount moving forward, which I am arguing against.The current situation is that we have a four year old daughter, were together for eight years, of which three years were married, and have been separated for almost two years. At the time of getting together, and up until our daughter was born, we both worked full time and earned a similar salary. When she went on maternity leave, I took on paying the mortgate in full, and she returned to work after maternity leave part-time (two/three days per week) as she wanted to spend more time with our daughter.Since separating, I have continued to pay the mortgage on the matrimonial home (whilst living in my overdraft, as I also have to pay for rent and living costs). We are almost agreed on selling the matrimonial home and splitting the proceeds accordingly - 60/40 in her favour. This will give her a nice lump sum as a deposit for another suitable property for her and our daughter (I currently have minimal access). I have also agreed to pay the CSA equivalent per month in child maintenance.The sticking point is over spousal maintenance. I am prepared to pay an amount until our daughter goes to school (in 18 months), at which time my ex-wife is able, qualified and has the means to return to full time education, earning the same as before maternity leave at the same level. However, she is asking for a nominal amount after this time, which concerns me somewhat. This is because paying a nominal amount could mean she can claim a larger amount in the future at any time for the rest of my life if she feels she wants to - for example, I get a pay rise, win the lottery, come into inheritance, or simply because she doesn't fancy working (which she is reluctant to do, especially when our daughter is full time in education). Also, I do not want her questioning me every time I go on holiday, get a new car, or similar....How would a court look at this paying of a nominal amount, and what is stopping her from claiming more in the future or stopping work, if she fancied doing so?

She sent a solicitors letter to my father claiming she had been harassed by him and if he didn't sign to say he had, and not to do it again; he would be taken to court. My father did work for her in this period in question, as did my mum as a gardener. My father left it and he never was brought before the court; it was her harassing him. See has called the police on three different issues; the light ; the cameras ; and our dog being out of control; the police told here to stop wasting police time. She then went to the dog warden to complain about the dog, the dog warden felt no further action required. She reported the light again but to the environmental health, no further action required.

(The focus is on this supporter because she is the ONLY 20 yearer) The applicant has poster slanderous poster around the village about my father, and was asked to take them down by a parish councilor.The strip of land in question WAS marked up in error by the council, we have emails from the definitive map officer saying it was as clear as mud why it was marked up; she couldn't produce any documentation to why it was marked up. Definitive map officer email - I am not sure why my predecessor did not notice that the route used along the Lane was not marked upon the definitive map.. An email from the Senior Public Rights of Way Officer stating - The definitive map officer and the public rights of way officer were correct in saying that currently X Lane nor the strip of land along the northern perimeter of your property is shown as a public right of way on the definitive map. I apologies, therefore, if the section 130A(6)(a) notice has confused matters again. Please regard the notice as none other than a formality X Council were obliged to serve after we had a section 130A(1) notice served on us. The latter deals with obstructions on highways and is a facility any member of the public can use if he or she believes a highway is obstructed and the highway authority are not doing anything about it. In the case of this particular section 130A(1) notice, we are not taking action because our records do not include the alleged highway to which it refers. But we still have to serve the section 130A(6)(a) notice in turn. It is then up to the server of the section 130A(1) notice whether the matter proceeds to court.We have photographic evidence the way in question was blocked by scaffolding and in-passable for a period of weeks (four years before the order started); in witness statements they claim to use the land frequently or every other day; no complains lodged during this period and statements specifying route was never obstructed only when we closed at the point the order came into questions.A legal right of way resided along the back gardens and runs parallel to the now proposed order, residing at the front of the houses along the lane; the legal right of way through the gardens has since been extinguished; immediately after, the now order in question, the DMMO was submitted. Can one be closed so close and another open? We are also trying to seek a statement off the previous land owner; to corroborate a neighbors statement that he went out and physically stopped people walking the route; that he saw down the PROW finger post at the top of the lane.This is our content for our statement of proof.

Silence might make this problematic. As to the other issue it seems to me you have two choices. You do not need their permission if the structure is on your land.

The practical issue is: a) Do you wait until the camper van is moved (presumably sometime in the better weather) and then do the work. b)Do you start court proceedings if they refuse to move the van. The advantage of a) is that it puts the neighbour in the position of having to instigate court proceedings if they think you are wrong. Whereas with b) the onus is upon you.

A couple of complications for you to ponder:  1) Railing unfortunately cannot be installed while Campervan is parked as its parked lengthways 15cm over the boundary. I think that is why it was moved into that position. They actually have 2 campervans (?!) and a car and the one parked on line of boundary is barely roadworthy so unfortunately I doubt it will be moved now unless we force it to be. It has actually damaged our small front wall in its current position as its bumper has cracked and displaced a 1ftx 1ft section of the wall so we were considering that this could be a useful reason for it to be moved back to where it used to be parked 40cm further over. What routes can we take to ensure van is moved?  2) There are some brick pavers laid on a 25cm strip identified as within the curtilage of our property which could be theirs - it's not clear. The boundary report identifies these pavers as tresspassing IF they are the neighbours property. We sent a detailed and evidenced communication on 11.11 requesting a boundary feature on the advised line or, if they were in disagreement, to provide their own evidenced understanding/undertake boundary assessment. The communication also asked the neighbours if the pavers were indeed their property, and if so to either remove or accept the installation of the railings may cause some minimal damage to a couple of the pavers. We allowed them a month to revert with a substantive response. Again they didn't respond on this point. One clear question I have on legal front is what are implications of installing railing over brick pavers, and causing damage a few. Can they successfully claim criminal damage when we gave an ample notice period and invited an evidenced counter claim? They have previously threatened criminal damage over a rotten fence post before so it's a likely outcome.  Please do not be misled into thinking we are being difficult. We have 65 A4 size disputes, complaints, ultimatums, threats and lies in the last 18 months usually over claims of our encroachment of 1cm. She has also been 'influencing' neighbours opinion. We have accommodated their wishes, hired professionals to advise, been reasonable and open, but nothing was working. In the end we asked them to stop sending emails unless they used a solicitor and now we are receiving solicitor letters.

If you are wrong it will prove expensive for you to find out. Assuming no cooperation with your neighbour then you only have two options. a) do nothing. b) commence action.

This letter he did receive had been sentby recorded delivery.They have billed him for work done to the car (\u00a3717) which he is willing to pay but they have also billed him for 113 days of storage at \u00a315 a day. Which came to \u00a31695!

My wife and I were to sell in Botswana, the friend remained in the UK. He was the sole investor in the business, to the tune of \u00a345k & had 50% of the shares, the remaining 50% divided between my wife & I. We have been trading for just over a year. The first year was pretty bruising as we got massively overcharged by everyone we engaged on a professional basis, from mechanics and printers through to accountants and clearing agents. We now have all the right people, through a very stressful process of elimination, but also of course had a large first year capital investment in vehicles, equipment etc. The upshot is that we headed into our second year much the wiser, with an extremely large customer base, but with a somewhat depleted working capital.To this end, I decided, for the good of the company, to resign my role as one of the Directors and pursue gainful employment in Botswana with a view to providing for all of our living expenses, thereby keeping more money in the company account to buy new stock and grow. My wife, as it turns out is eminently capable of running the business all by herself. A good solution to our problems, we thought.Regarding my employment, Botswana employment laws for foreigners are very strict in that if a job can be done by a Botswana national, it is not open to foreigners, so quite restrictive. I can get employed because I am a qualified airline pilot and although I am not able to fly (I have to revalidate my license every year at enormous expense), I can certainly do ground instruction. The government has just started a programme of sponsored ab initio commercial pilot tuition requiring both flying and ground school instructors. This is where I come in. One problem.Our UK investor / 50% shareholder has my license / paperwork I need to show to begin this job. I left these documents with him for safe keeping. However, despite repeated requests from us both, he is refusing to send them unless I meet his demands. These are my immediate & full resignation from the company, me relinquishing my 25% shareholding in the company, a cash payment of \u00a315000 to him and the appointment of a new director of his choosing. If these demands are not met, no license. His justification, such as it is, is that I hoodwinked and conned him into thinking I wanted to be part of this business just so I could come to Botswana, abandon the business & get a job flying. He overlooks the fact I simply can't fly without a recertified license. The best I can hope for is a gig ground schooling a group of people in an accent they barely understand, a subject they understand even less and field questions they ask in an accent I barely understand. Interesting, maybe, but glamorous? Nope. Anyway, surely if this was some kind of weird masterplan I had, I would probably have brought the documents with me.Anyhow, he remains intransigent, so my question is: Where do I stand here? While his position is definitely hostile, is it illegal? What he is doing seems to be theft (my license) and extortion (demanding money and my apparent annihilation before he considers returning my property). I can provide his latest email on request, an interesting collection of threats."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "18/01/17 22:56", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "As I recall the FP for cannabis possession has been \u00a390 for several years.

My pensionMy current thinking is that I would give her- half my pension,- the house ( although I am not clear whether I should offer to continue to pay the repayments for a certain period while she looks to sell and realise the cash and buy a miore suitable property elsewhere)- most contents of the house and the car ( I would keep some stuff but not very much )- and about \u00a330K from the savings account...That would leave me with around \u00a3200K including my inheritance which would be enough to start anew I think...I would like to offer up some kind of monthly amount as well, but not sure if that needs to be done privately...Any thoughts on whether I am not giving enough or indeed giving too much?many Thanks!!Dezzouk"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "27/01/17 22:28", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "her estate, As for executor's expenses  it is only out of pocket exs for yourself.But exs for maintaining the house can be claimed -- get receipts for everything you pay for in case other beneficiaries question it later.

The offences being assault on both my brother and his wife. We had been drinking.To cut it short it was self defence. I had a row with my bro because he won't do more with my mother. I am her carer, I left a great job 2 years ago to care for her in my home because she was facing life in a home for the elderly. My bro has never helped out, never visits etc. Anyway his wife got involved(she isn't a nice person) I was pushed to the floor and kicked (I took photos of bruising to my arms) I fought back, swinging punches also. Police arrived. I was arrested and charged.On the court date I told my solicitor I wanted to plead guilty to get it over with. I am in the process of moving to a different town, far away from them. Despite them being responcible also. My solicitor wasn't happy and told me I stand a chance of going to prison if I plead guilty. Then he showed me the two statements, and I felt sick to the stomach.My sis in law stated that I had pulled her by the hair and threw her to the floor then repeatedly kicked her in the ribs. All untrue. Apparantly they went to the hospital etc to have it recorded. ( she is a clever woman) I do know she had one bruise under one eye, so the statement said.There was video evedence from the arresting police officer of me being arrested. It didn't look good me mouthing off that they were as much to blame and get away scot free.I had a chance of pressing charges against them but I thought not, as I don't want to antgonise them anymore. Before the police arrived that night they both, mostly her, threatened me with reprisals, such as their freinds, which I have met, and are of the nasty sort.I am due for trial on 13th of march at magistrates court. I was found guilty of the same charge in the 2000 (an ex girlfiend in a fight) other than that I have not been in trouble since but for a drunk driving and a ban in 2005.I am worried sick about my mother as she will be put in a home if I go to prison. She depends on me 24/7.Two years ago I took courses in Electrical Grid and Offshore Turbines. A guilty verdict will no doubt spoil my chances of work, but my mum is my main concern.So what I am asking is do I make provisions for her now, get her ready for the prospects of a home? Jut in case I get prison.I have been told by my sister that my bro and his wife are going all out to have me sent down, which will mean more lies.

In order to use such a \"drive in\" it is required that you have a dropped kerb and ramp installed through the local council after obtaining the necessary planning permission. There are two problems now arising from this type of modification. The first problem arises because cars have now become wider and longer, this means that if you exchange your Ford Focus or Vauxhall Corsa for a new Audi, Peugeot Estate or similar vehicle, it will no longer fit on the \"drive in\" but will be left with two to three feet of vehicle protruding out passed your property line and onto the public footpath creating a hazard for pedestrians, especially those with sight impairments or mobility problems. The second problem is in the way the dropped kerb and ramp are constructed. The footpaths in this area are roughly six feet wide, if done correctly the construction will grade the slope of the ramp across the whole width of the footpath leaving a gentle slope. Unfortunately some ramps have been constructed with the gradient in the first two to three feet, then levelling off as the ramp approaches the property line. This leaves a fairly steep gradient on the road side of the footpath which combined with a protruding front end of the parked vehicle forces pedestrians onto the steeper part of the footpath. As we are now into the season of ice, snow and fog this means that in many instances pedestrians will be forced to walk on steeply sloping, iced up pavements, at risk of falls and injuries through no fault of their own. My questions are, are you allowed to treat the public footpath as part of your drive in and park with a large part of your vehicle protruding onto the footpath, and if, because of this a pedestrian slips on a badly constructed ramp, who is responsible? I have posed this question to several friends and have had various answers including, \" It must be the Council as they permitted it to be built\". \"It must be the homeowner as they have parked in an inconsiderate manner\". \" It must be the Council contractors as they have built the ramp in this way\".

If he does not record ID when he did not discuss with his clients the legal requirements for him to act..   I know now what he knew then,  So if we had no contract would it be fair to say.. That A solicitor is criminaly liable, for this first instance..and the profound loss, and physical damage that solicitor caused. If the unscrupoulus solicitor is (assuming all this is all factual.) If criminal liability under a Duty of care can be proven..who is responsible for investigating, other serous omissions in serious offence of Fraud. What should a person do in a situation like this?

On taking up this new role he committed to taking no further financial interest in the first company, but as the new role was only temporary did not resign as a director of the first company.

I have 2 trustees, one of whom is a family member and one who is a financial advisor. I have put the policy in an Absolute Trust with one of my children as sole beneficiary. Sadly my relationship withthat childhas broken down and there has been no contact for a few years. I would still however like to make some provision there, but not for the full value of the policy.When I set up the trust, I did so in such a way thatneither family membersnor future childrencan be added to the trust document - my child is named asSOLE beneficiary.I've since had another child and I am in a new relationship. I would therefore like to be able to alter the trust, but I know that with it being an Absolute Trust, that isn't technically possible.Under normal circumstances I would simply cancel the policy and set up a new one with both of my children as beneficiaries, but I have contracted a serious lifelong illness which will prevent me from being able to get a new policy. As fate would have it, my illness does not meet the policy's definitions so I won't receive a critical illness payment.I would like to add my 2nd child to the policy (I never envisaged I would have another.) Is there any way by which I can amend the trust, or is there a legal workaround which would perhaps \"over-ride\" the Absolute Trust or allow trustees to split the payment to both children etc etc?I appreciate that this is a complicated one - my life is never simple :) Any help would be greatly appreciated."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "15/11/16 15:16", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "mentioned whether the annex has been registered with the Land Registry.

Almost certainly your wife is entitled to at least 50% of the original house as I again assume that with five children you have been married some years. As to the Annexe you will find yourself tangled up in the law of equity if there is no settlement.  Almost certainly the in laws have an equitable interest having paid for the development. the argument will be what level that is. Clearly from one viewpoint the land is worthless - it would be unsellable on the open market as a separate plot. Clearly you would not permit a total stranger to have built an annexe. From another point of view they were able to build their annexe cheaply as they did not pay for the land. Therefore it had a value to them. As all of you failed to adhere to the most basic of principles and did not record the nature and extent of your agreement you all find yourself in a mess. For what it is worth I suspect in the absence of an agreement a court would probably find it hard to credit that you gave up the land unconditionally merely for use. I suspect the outcome would be the land would be valued on the basis of its worth to them at the time. However that is not by any means a certainty. How much did the extension cost to build. It seems hard to imagine with the housing market that a home valued in  2009 at \u00a3220000 which has a large extension of two bedrooms and a living area added is still only worth \u00a3300k.

I have moved into temporary accommodation away from my wife and 5 children. Our family home is currently valued at \u00a3300k (we have had 4 valuations that all arrived at this figure). In 2009 we built an Annexe to accommodate my Wife's Parents and her Sister. All the valuations we have had for the family home have arrived at a figure of \u00a3220k before the Annexe was built and \u00a3300k as the property stands now. The Annexe consists of a self contained \"Flat\" downstairs where my Wife's Parents live, and, two bedrooms and one en-suite upstairs which is connected to the main property and is used by my wife and 5 children (and myself prior to my Wife ending our Marriage). The Annexe was paid for, in full, by my Wife's Parent's and we had an agreement such that they didn't have to pay me (as the Land Owner) any money for the Land they took to build their Annexe \u2013 which included the demolishing of my garage \u2013 as well as the daily use of the surrounding land, Driveway, gardens etc, and, in return I would be given ownership of the upstairs 2 bedrooms that are part of the Annexe. My Wife's Parents have since reneged on this agreement and have said that it \"never happened\" and that the agreement was in fact that we only had USE of the extra Bedrooms but ownership stayed with them. Bearing this in mind I have asked my Wife's Parents to pay for the Land that they took to Build their Annexe (as well as the rest of my Land that they use on a daily basis) but they refuse to do so and (wait for it....) they have been to the CIB who have informed them that my Land is worthless..... Obviously I know that this is complete rubbish, but where do I stand legally? NOTHING is documented regarding ownership of the Annexe - the Mortgage and complete ownership is soley in my name. My wife and her Parents are telling me that I should accept \u00a3110k from them, ie, half the value of the House prior to the building of the Annexe.

I had an issue about not being paid a bonus related to loyalty that was paid to other managers who were male while I was on maternity leave and raised this with him when I returned. The business was about to make redundancies and I offered to volunteer over one of my team colleagues who was able to take on my job. I said I would volunteer if he would pay me all my benefits and PILON as well as maternity pay because I was trying for another baby & knew I would not get such generous benefits if I left - there was also a risk I was also hoping to be pregnant by the time I left. All of this was agreed and signed in to the agreement. When I talked to an independent solicitor for advice he explained that the issue regarding non payment of the bonus that had upset me could mean we could say that under the Vento guidelines we could assign some of the money as an injury to feelings payment. This was drafted in to the agreement & discussed with my managing director. It helped save me tax and the company NI on the payment too. It is important to mention that my managing director spoke to the global head of my function in HR (who I don't report to but is also responsible for me) about me leaving and he was fully aware the agreement existed. I'm not sure if he saw a copy but there were emails confirming he knew of an agreement and if he had asked he would have been able to see a copy. As well as this there was a list of all people leaving and their leaving costs to make financial provisions and I worked with the head of finance on this. The finance director also had visibility of this list and could see my proposed settlement payment so could have raised concerns at any time. After my agreement was signed my managing director said he was also considering leaving as he had recently experienced high stress and illness and it had made him think about early retirement. He spoke to his bosses and global HR head and they asked me (because I work in HR) to provide a breakdown of the exit package. I sent this to them in detail and the head of the global business signed an agreement for him to go in September. A new managing director was appointed from July and kept asking me if I would consider staying on in a flexible capacity to support them with some important issues, eventually I said I would. The head of legal was asked to draft a consultancy agreement for this with me & he asked if he could see my settlement agreement and I thought this was to ensure I had indemnified the company from liability of tax- which I had. This last week (my last week at work) they suddenly said they couldn't let me stay on which I was surprised about but ok with but I just found out that they suspended my expenses access and also the finance director asked the payroll clerk to stop my payments being paid- unfortunately for them I have already been paid my money last week on pay day. It is clear that they are investigating my agreement & I don't know why- I have not committed any wrongdoing and the claims I had were legitimate.my managing director at the time had full responsibility for the budget and these decisions and had signed off many settlement agreements without additional authority.

It raises several complex issues. Originally it was Crown land and subject to a thirty year period. So clearly in 2013 that had not expired and title was still good. My guess is that the ten years starts in 1995 as it is the adverse possession of the land which starts time ( who owns it only goes to how long is necessary to bring a claim). Generally speaking when a property is purchased the purchaser is advised to check the property to see who is in occupation and check what rights they may have.  Clearly it would have been apparent on inspection and enquiry to see what was happening. So I cannot see why an application could not be made immediately. The real issue is that such an application is easily opposed which will prevent registration of the land in the claimants name. The actual landowner can then easily evict the claimant who is in effect a squatter (trespasser). It is therefore likely that the squatter will lose the land and face a large bill of costs. If the squatter wants to keep the land it may be better to make an offer. Presumably the landowner is unaware of the situation and has obviously been unconcerned about the factual situation.

I tried to ascertain how long this had been occupied and my research indicated that this was in the late nineties having been vacated bona vacantia to the crown in the 1988. As such they neither had the requisite 12 years or, as I found out, 30 years for crown land.  At this time I did not know about the LRA 2002. I continued with the purchase of the then unregistered plots which was completed in 2013 showing my company as the registered owner.  I now wish to develop the land and wish to negotiate with the occupier who has indicated that they can claim it under possesory title.  They did not submit a clam to the land registry before I purchased the land but have now occupied it for 28 years in total.  I have read that regardless of how long they have occupied it as the registered owner the 2002 act is what the land registry will use under a possesory title claim. If I read this correctly then the length of time it has been occupied is not an issue so long as it is over 10 years, and that all I would need to do would be to object to the application and proceed to stop the other party using it within two years.

It was moms house , she bought the house from the sale of my fathers house when he died many years ago , and it was my mom who had the mortgage. He was a bit of a freeloader. He was not ok with not owing the house , and believed my moms business and assets where much higher than they were.we got to our day in court . With limited funds and looming costs which would of cost my sister loosing her home, we had no choice but to sign a tomlin order, giving him the house and the engagement and wedding rings he bought mom. In exchange he would give us back my moms ashes and some personal items from our family history. We begrudgingly signed.We tried to give him the rings, which were the rings mom was wearing when she died , they were even still in the sealed envelope from the hospital. We then tried to arrange an exchange at the solicters . He refused . I presume he destroyed them sometime I between the inventory and court. Panicked when we asked for them and said yes.He died a few days ago , and as I see it the tomlin order should be revoked? As there is 100% no chance of closing the deal snd recovering items .Although desth is sad , please understand my family have endured 27 years of physical and mental abuse due to this horrible man . even after the tomlin , he was still parking outside my sisters house and smashing windows, death threats .

In my case I was lucky that on the day that the FPN turned up in the post, I just happened to strike up a conversation in the pub with someone that I later discovered was a barrister. He volunteered to make representations to the LA on my behalf. He assured me that I had not committed a crime, and, after his letters had been ignored a number of times, he rang the legal dept at the LA, they agreed that the FPN should not have been issued and exercised their right to make it go away.  My experience was stressful enough for me to attempt to ensure that others are not mistreated by an LA that incidentally is likely to pay a shed load of money (read: millions) to a private security firm that offers a free service.  My end game is to coerce the LA to not treat residents and visitors as cash cows. I hope that they will employ their own staff and use those members of staff to, primarily educate the public and then, if neccessary, \"fine\" them. Additionally, I hope that they will provide bins that are close to the areas where smokers congregate and to remember to that littering is not just confined to those areas that generate the most \"fine\" based income.

She walked out 2 years ago, and has never paid anything towards the cost of the family home, ALL bills and costs have been paid by him even though she has been in full time employment for their wholemarried life (31 years). All of her earnings went into a private bank account to which only she has access. The house she now lives in was left to her by her mother and she sold a one third share to their son. She has changed her address to this house for post purposes but is still using the family home address for registering her car and for voting purposes even though she has not lived there for 2 years.My friend is wondering 1) Can she force him to sell the family home.

The situation is complicated, so please bear with me, and I appreciate any advice.The company that I work for was a small company which got acquired by a much bigger technology firm 2 years ago. Upon acquisition we were forced to sign quite wide ranging restrictive covenant agreements which incorporate the entire technology offering of the firm - which essentially covers the entire industry that I'm in as it's a huge end-to-end service provider. Sign the covenant or you no longer have a job. So whilst I sell service A and it makes up 100% of my business, I'm now restricted from services A, B, C, D, E, F, ........ some of which I know nothing about and have no interaction with, but others I'm actively involved in or at least have oversight of, and this covers both direct and indirect competition. But either way my current employer is involved in almost all aspects of the service industry, almost anyone who would employ me is a competitor in some form whether directly or indirectlyI'm considering some opportunities to change job. The main one would not be considered a competitor to my current employer, but they are looking to develop and promote a product which would be a functional competitor to some aspects of say service C - it's ultimate aim is to get the customer to the same place as service C but only doing so in a narrower fashion. I have seen lots of presentations where our current competitors are mentioned, but never this company.1) Given the situation is this likely to be a breach of the restrictive covenant?2) Given how broadly the covenant is written, would it stand up in UK law?3) How much information do I have to provide to my current employer upon tendering notice?

Last summer we went back to see family in China when we were caught in a devastating explosion which caused horrific injuries to my girlfriend and my parents. Little did we know, when we told the \"friend\" who was meant to be looking after our pets in the UK, she decided to take advantage. She started living out of our apartment with her boyfriend and absolutely trashed the place, including causing a flood which caused circa \u00a310,000 of damage. When I got back to the UK and tried to have a conversation with her about this, she got her boyfriend and friend to ambush and assault me, but worse of all, she then filed a frivolous lawsuit because she managed to get a solicitors firm to take on her case on a No-Win No-Fee basis. As she does not have to pay for representation, she has been enabled to pursue this vexatious case on a low risk/high reward basis. If she wins she gets a huge payout, if she loses she can just leave the country as she is a foreign national, and we wouldn't be able to pursue her liability. We've talked to many different organisations about this, including the police, the council, our MP, Citizens Advice, Legal Aid, various free legal advice agencies and charities, no one can help. The answer we've been given is that they are sympathetic, but there isn't anything they can do and that we should pursue this through the judicial system, except if we do this, we lose either way. By progressing this all the way through the system, we are paying \u00a320,000 if not \u00a330,000 or more in just our own legal fees. If it were not for my parents, we would currently be destitute. Our previous solicitors firm agreed to act for us on a fee cap basis, whereby we agree how much funds are required to get us up to a certain stage in the proceedings and we then put these funds on account, when the fund is used up, they let us know and we decide whether we will put more money on account or where we decide if we want to stop instructing them and start representing ourselves. They have dragged this case out for 6 months already, and now aside from having used up funds we have placed on account, are trying to charge us for even more money, claiming that we owe them a further \u00a39000 and that if we don't pay this, they will exercise Lien and won't provide our files to us or our new solicitors. The solicitors on the other side, know full well this is a frivolous case, but because they know I own a property (which is mortgaged) are pursuing this case anyway, as they know we are caught in a vulnerable position and may not be able to defend this case financially and emotionally. They have already filed a claim for over \u00a360,000, even though the only evidence they have is the word of their client claiming she is a tenant, two deposits of \u00a3350 made into my account without my knowledge, a handwritten, unsigned tenancy agreement and a social media post by my girlfriend looking for a flat mate. This girl has taken advantage of us when we were at our most vulnerable, where every organisation has failed us and left at the mercy of solicitor firms who only care about what is billable, as opposed to what is right and just. We cannot even recover from the trauma we suffered in China, but have instead had to defend ourselves from this malicious lawsuit which has well and truly ruined our lives.

When this was first proposed, my brother pointed out that if the extension ran up to the property boundary then the neighbour would have problems carrying out any work on the extension without coming on to his (my brother's) land. The neighbour told my brother it was his 'right' to build up to the edge of his property and he intended to do so. The extension is now in placeand my brother recently came home to find a Sky engineer in his rear garden, with a ladder propped up against his rear wall and preparing to install a Sky T.V. dish on the side of the extension. My brother told him to get out of the garden or he would set his dog on him. At no time has the neighbour asked permission for this work to be carried out and when approached he told my brother 'I am a builder, I know about these things and I am entitled to have work done to my extension even if it means accessing your property to do it'. This work is still not done and my brother is still refusing to allow Sky on to his property to complete the work.The second problem is at the front of the houses, where the downpipe for the guttering is on the neighbour's side. The gutter is, or was semi round cast iron. The guttering on my brother's side was renewed about 18 months ago as it was badly corroded. The neighbour recently told my brother that he was going to re-new his front guttering, which he has now done. Unfortunately the neighbour replaced the old guttering with plastic in a completely different shape. When my brother pointed out that he would need an adaptor to connect up to my brothers gutter the neighbour told him 'I am not paying for that'. He then went on to fit an end cap to the end of his guttering, where it would normally be connected to the rest of the gutter. The result of this, much to my brother's amusement, is that now when it rains, the rainwater runs down his gutter and jets out of the dis-connected endand runsdown the side of the neighbour's house front. The neighbour is furious about this and has now had a solicitor's letter sent to my brother demanding he do something about this situation. My brother has not replied to the solicitor but has pointed out to the neighbour that the problem is all of his own making and by simply fitting an adaptor in place of the end cap the problem will be solved. The neighbour's reply was to the effect that he was 'entitled' to change the configuration of his guttering and it was now my brother's reponsibility to stop the rainwater damaging his(the neighbour's,) house.I am inclined to agree with my brother but what is the legal position with regard to these two problems?"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "15/01/16 00:04", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "Having read your post I have to ask, are you in a Union, if so what have they done as regards representation at this hearing, and if you are not in a Union, who is representing you at the hearing?

They sent me a contract which stated the start of employment would be the 3rd of May, this contract was dependant on passing the pre employment checks. I electronically signed the contract the same day. On the 18th of April I called the HR department for the company seeking further information in regards to the pre employment checks. I wanted to give enough notice as possible to my current employer out of respect for them. I was told during this phonecall that I had passed the pre employment checks and that I could hand in my notice. This was also acknowledged via email. I handed in my notice to my current employer the same day. On the 26th of April i received an email stating that my offer had been withdrawn due to defaults on my credit report. (I was very upfront and honest with the company about having a poor credit report from defaults in the past which included a satisfied CCJ) So 8 days after I was told the pre employment checks were successfull and told to hand in my notice I was then told my offer had been retracted. Thankfully my current district manager allowed me to continue for my current company, This was an extremely embarassing situation having to beg for my job back after handing in my notice. I have been with this employer five years almost, never been in any disciplinary troubles and never been off sick. I feel that this is very much going to halt my career progression in the current company, I already feel as if I am not being treated the same as I was before I handed in my notice.My question is legally do I have any grounds for legal help in this matter.

Either way, if the judge felt hearing about it would add no material weight to the case before him/her, he/she has the right to dispense with it.  Whether you liked their wording of how they dispensed with it is largely immaterial. You need to remember that your allegation is just that, an ALLEGATION, the judge made no finding of fact, so it remains that, an allegation.  You presumably had ample opportunity to report this alleged rape to the appropriate authorities (i.e. the police) when it happened and to allow them to investigate at the time it allegedly occurred.  If you chose not to, you will have to accept that a family court judge will be less likely to believe it is a pertinent fact in the case before him. This is not a judgement on whether you were raped or not...just whether or not such information is relevant to the family court. You remain free to report the alleged rape to the police, and would be strongly advised to do so if you want justice.  Justice for your alleged rape is not likely to be found in the family courts in a child arrangements case.

Initially I was to receive money from entrance charges on open days, while the charity paid for the initial setup costs through receiving grants and other charity funding. Longer term the charity was to start bringing local disadvantaged children onto the site, where they were to be paid by the local authority. Over the initial few months I asked on numerous occasions when all this was to be set up, but Mr Byford continually came up with different \"reasons\" (excuses) for this not having been done. This also went on with other legal details, including the rental of the land. After 6 months with still no agreements in place I started to seriously question Mr Byford what was going on and why these things hadn't been sorted! Mr Byford then decided that the Matt and Beanie, two volunteers that had been helping out for the past few months while they kept their own chickens on site, had to make a choice, either move off, or donate their chickens, coops, feeders etc to the charity! They seemed to have decided to stay. At this point nothing was said to me.Unfortunately due to the fact I was not prepared to \"donate\" everything I had to the farm I ended up being told I was no longer welcome up there. I have now been trying to move all my animals and bits somewhere else, it took some time to find a new site for the animals and have now located somewhere, but on the last 2 occasions when I have tried to get the animals we have meet a torrent of verbal abuse. I only want to reclaim all that is mine, nothing more. Although \"banned\" from the site, I have been regularly visiting outside of normal hours to check on the animals etc, and all seem ok, however Animal Health and Trading Standards have recently been up there to check on the site. And as they say there is no smoke without fire. The verbal abuse we received on the last visit when we tried to obtain the animals has also lead to many of my friends not really wanting to help now. One of those who helped out also received a message through facebook,Hi Rob I understand you. Attended the field of dreams farm in thurston today to remove items allegedly belonging to Dave Muskett For your information trading standards, RSPCA and DEFRA have all been informed of his behaviour after he was respectfully requested to inform us when he would be attending We are considering taking legal action, could you therefor provide me with a full company name and address to send paperwork toI hereby clarify anything being removed from the farm will be classed as theft and dealt with in that manner. I hope this is clear enough Many thanks Mark Byford Crack On Foundation. I have tried to ask so many people now it is getting very down-heartening, all I want is to get my animals and belongings back, therefore I am asking anyone possible if they might be able to help. I am seeking legal advice as what to do next. I have a group of people who have agreed if it comes to it to simply go there and collect all that is mine! What I want to know is can they claim theft of what is effectively my own property? If you are able to spare a little time to answer this question I would be extremely grateful.

A brief background to the story: I am in disagreement with National Grid in reference to a gas disconnection due to them failing to notice that the existing meter did not confirm to the current standard and as a consequence I did not have any supply. National grid were appointed to install new gas piping to my property. They have had access to my property at least 4 times, to arrange visual viewing with at least 2 times taking pictures with an Ipad on the existing piping and meters. NG insist that no access was provided and that a Survey letter sent to me and placed in the communal area, was not responded to. I did not receive the letter, however prior to the installation they gained access and advised me the area where the meter will be moved to. Upon installation of the piping they had the 2 afore mentioned viewings where photos were taken.  8 months later from the initial pipe installation, they visited to transfer the meter from the previous piping to the newly installed one. On this day they noted that the meter was outdated and I will be disconnected for the foreseable future until my gas supplier provides me with a new meter meeting the current standard. This has led to 32 days without gas. While this delays was caused by the supplier, NG are adamant that with the meter being outdated the Supplier should pay me compensation. While that is correct in some aspect, it was them who initiated the disconnection due to their failure in identifying a disconnection risk. Having asked all the details held by them under a subject access request, I was refused as they are outside the FIA, however they replied to me with a brief summary: - Survey letter sent and not actioned by me (not received but in the communal area) - They access my property ONLY twice, the physical installation of the pipe and the other occasion at disconnection I am 100% sure that access was gained more than those 2 times, that the survey was made, as a consequence of which installation took place, that further visits were undertaken with pictures taken and that they had ample time and visits to notice the non-conformity of the meter.

Plenty of wills create as many issues as the solve.

My contract was terminated on 13th November 2015 for gross misconduct. I viewed the accusing statements 20 minutes before the termination. I was affronted. I did not have a clue of a definite termination until the 11th November 2015 via letter but was not clear as to why. During those weeks I did not earn any other source of income apart  from receiving  pay owing and holiday pay. I had attended a meeting the previous week where I was told I should be back at work the next week (the week of my termination) after the reviewing of statements regarding the September 21st incidents - BUT - the statements from staff? regarding an 'incident report' I had put in regarding a patient - in August of the same year was also being reviewed. This was a separate incident. Once they were reviewed I would be allowed back. I had no idea it was turned into such an investigation and feel it was used as an excuse to keep me off work. The statements related to this August issue were dated 4th October. I had a security meeting about the patient on the 14th October. My contract was terminated in relation to the statements of the August incident. The patient had hit me another member of staff and distress other patients to the point that I had to intervene. I submitted an ACAS form on the 8th October 2015 when I became concerned with the delay in me getting me back to work. acas contacted the employers but I cannot remember the date.

This dog we had fostered and then found a new forever home for her 18 months ago when she was about 5 months old. We had had her vaccinated and microchipped so she was fully registered into our names, so when adopting this dog the owners were passed the signed paperwork for them to change the details for the microchip. They were also given the second part paid in full vaccination appoinment to get done and asked to change her into their address so she is no longer linked to our account. The vets on Friday stated to us the dog had been running loose on the main A30 and nearly caused a RTA and risked being killed, so someone stopped and retrieved her from the middle of the road and took her into the vets. She was not wearing an id tag so the microchip info was sourced. We were very concerned for the dog's welfare. We no longer had the new owner's (the adopters) contact details - neither full name, address or home number (the lady had sent us one photo on our mobile over 10 months ago which we couldn't retrieve and was subsequently deleted, so we couldn't make contact with them). I contacted my vet to see if the dog had in fact had her second vaccination and if the new owners either transferred her over to their own named account or if another vet had asked them to fax over the pet's history. Although the vaccination had been done, neither a vet nor the owner had transferred the dog away from us, so we couldn't get any contact details that way.  My vet told us she was our responsibilitly and we should collect the dog as she could have been rehomed and or abandonded and as registered to us we would be responsible for both the dog and all costs and bills and our rights were not relinquished as we'd thought. I telephoned the vets back an hour later and explained I would have to get a taxi to collect our car at my husband's work but hoped to be there before they closed (to not incur overnight care at the vets). I collected the dog out of legal obligation; we didn't want the RSPCA claiming that we were the ones to abandon her, or to mount up huge costs if no one else claimed her it would have come back to us and us alone. When we got the dog home, although in good health and condition it was very clear the dog had not had any form of dog training continued. She snapped at our own dog (who had been around when we fostered her), got over a fence and attacked a chicken and constantly terrorised our cats. She was hyper-vigilantant ready for the kill on seeing a chicken or cat and no way could she remain with us and be a real risk to our family pets. We didn't know at the time of collecting her this would be an issue, as when she was a young puppy we were training and socialising her and she was acting appropriatley with supervision. That night she barked and howled all night long, destroying a dog bed we had provided her with and attacking her crate to get to any cats. We were at our witts end by Saturday morning - we had been checking Gumtree, Preloved, Pets4Home, Cornish radios, missing pets and lost and found pets pages in cornwall on facebook to see if the owners had reported her as missing, but to no avail. At 11am I started ringing around the rescue centres to admit her - three said no and they all had long waiting lists which I was put on at least one. One told us they had no hope in hell of re-homing such a dog with existing pets and have we thought what is best for her if long term pound was her only option.....being PTS We checked all the sites until mid afternoon, as we could no longer keep her in our home, then put her up for adoption for a nominal fee of \u00a350 to ensure a good home. We found and home checked a pet-free couple who longed for a dog local to us and spent a good deal of time with them. We expressed concerns over the height of a damaged wall which they assured us they would get sorted and raised and in the meantime wouldn't let her off and would use an extendable lead in the garden as we explained what had happened at ours the night before. Apparantly, on Saturday morning the adopters had contacted Lost and found at Petlog so they knew then that the microchip was still registered to us. They knew where we lived and had our home and mobile numbers yet failed to make contact with us until Monday late afternoon (why did they wait so long?). When they eventually phoned us we explained what had happpened and were totally honest and upfront with them and stated how sorry we were that we hadn't been able to find them and had unfortunately had to rehome her after 24 hours. We invited them to come right away to our home so we could quickly get the matter sorted. They did come here and we contacted the people who had had the dog for 48 hours at this point and again explained the adopters had now made contact and could we sort this out as they want their dog back. They refused and also threatened us that if we gave their name, address or telephone numbers out they would take legal action against us. We were on the telephone with the adopters present and having a three way conversation until 9pm but nothing was resolved. Tuesday I spent all day on the telephone mediating between the two couples. I spoke to pet log who confirmed that the adopters had never logged the paperwork for the chip to be changed and it was never pending like she claimed - she only contacted petlog re the chip today. I was deeply upset - there had been a catalogue of errors to have had this happen - the microchip was NEVER changed, the dog was NEVER taken off our vet account and the dog DIDN'T have a legal tag or engraved collar with its up-to-date details on.  We took back a dog who was dangerous around our much loved family pets who mean a lot to our children too and we were placed in a desparate situation where we needed her safe and away from us. This has caused me and my family so much upset and stress and we have tried to help solve this matter at all times. We have been harrassed by both other parties at one time or other. We have  put the welfare of the dog first. Don't forget - we had no way of knowing if the dog had been abandonned. We didn't even know if she was still with the people we'd originally passed her on to. All we knew was that we were the only people that the dog could be traced to (vet records, microchip) so we actually then had a legal duty on us to ensure the dog's best interest were met. Unfortunately that meant having to rehome her again and that we did - finding new owners and checking out that they and their home were suitable. We even told them the circumstances by which we had the dog back in our possession, so they knew the facts from the start. Today both parties seem to have posted on the same forum. This seems to have forced the people we rehomed the dog to at the weekend to phone us today and relent to give the dog back. my husband then asked if we could give out their contact details for them to sort the matter out between them (previously we had not been allowed to do this) and they said yes this time. We were again hassled to return the \u00a350 immediately. However, only when given proof that the dog was safely returned to the adopters did my husband then immediately release the \u00a350 back to the couple who had her since Saturday night (by immediate bank transfer like they had paid to us in the first place, with a siged re-homing letter with our details, vets and past history, so full transparancy at all times). I hope this puts our facts across and that the actions we took were nothing more than putting a dog first. This was not an act of theft, fraud or deception in any shape or form. It's a series of errors and circumstances which thankfully have been resolved with the dog back with the adopters. They now need to ensure the dog is fully registered with them - they have legal obligations  to ensure the dog can be traced back to them AT ALL TIMES - which means getting a proper tag or engraved collar that doesn't fall off all the time (remember there is a huge fine if a dog's details are not correct). Ensuring microchip details are correct at all times and ensuring vet ownership is transfered and up-to-date would have prevented all this happening in the first instance. You cannot rely on previous owners to know who the dog is currently with and their address details and only ever acted in the dogs very best interest, at very great cost to us - it is the current owner of an animal that has to ensure these are all in place.", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "17/03/16 03:39"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "You'll understand that the advice was given on the information provided by the two, er, shall we say, holders of the dog.

My issue is as follows, I have a small accountancy firm Called Shires Accountants Limited which I established in 2007 as a partnership and in 2013/4 we incorporated as limited again in the same trading name.I noted a month or so ago that another company had set up as accountants with a virtually identical name LLP status Shire Accountants LLP. Therefore I applied to Companies House to have them removed from the register under the Companies Act. My application for removal was successful and they had to rename there company. The company did rename but have rebadged as a new LTD (Shropshire Accountants Ltd trading as Shire Accountants.  The company have further acquired a domain name similar to ours and are now loading in his google listings which is confusing customers.The MD of the firm is refusing to accept any responsibility and Nominet now want \u00a3750 plus VAT to decide if the domain use is abusive. Further its hard to believe but it does get worse!! after some research it has been established that the MD who supposedly is an accountant is in a CVA on a different company for over 200K most of which is owed to HMRC further he is also in a personal IVA. (All in public record) Therefore even if i win any court proceedings say for \"Pass off\" I have little or no chance of recovering my costs. Has any one come across similar situations... any help or advice would be much appreciated.

The job was as an eCommerce administrator. In my first day of being their I was told if I did not learn quickly I would be out of the door on my second day the manager again made a very long speech saying if I did not pick things up quick I would be sacked on my 3rd day again he said this but also made reference to my last employer and said you will be sacked again also here wont you.Then when I came in just before new year he told me if I do not improve or think I can do better to not to bother coming back in the new year. I thought the job was to list products and make the listings better on their ebay store as he during the interview talked alot about what I can design on photoshop I even showed him new designs I had done before the second interview happened. I was led to believe my tasks would be sorting out the ebay store but what I ended up doing was inputting data from excel into a computer system when was stock control I did this about 4 hours a day transferring stock from one system to another and creating invoices for orders. This was not mentioned in the interview and I found myself doing this alone while the manager did very little work and even spent half the day out of the office. I was doing other jobs too such as answering phone calls emails and ebay messages all relating to car parts. Then a new person started I was told he would be doing some of the invoicing but as 4 weeks went bye he never did any.I reported my manager to HR for his behaviour and when the gm talked to him about what he said to me he denied everything he ever said to me.The gm manager then said I am not calling you a liar but the manager said he never said anything to you. In my opinion this is calling me a liar as I had no motive to lie.Then at my first month probation he came up with mistakes I had made such as not writing down the details of an order I had made and the odd mistake on the data input I was doing. This manager had recorded dates on when I had made a mistake and what the mistake was as a new starter you make mistakes. I informed the gm I was dyslexic as I wanted to be honest.Then I was told you have a month to improve then in my second probation the manager came up with 13 errors I had made but according to him he only told me about 4 of them. Again I told the gm I did not come here to do data input and would you go to someone who treated you like shit when you started the managers method of training was it was up to me to ask questions all the time and make notes he expected me to ask all the time. Their had been no training structure.Then because the Gm did not understand all the ins and outs of what I had done wrong decided to bring the manager into the meeting and he went on telling what I had done wrong with the data inputting small mistakes out of like 1000 orders over weeks. Basically putting wrong figures in but this was a job I never wanted to do. I was still trying to get my head around the system. I then said you don't come to someone who lies and denies saying things when you said those things he did not deny saying those things to me in this meeting.The Gm also asked me why I had thought I was going to get sacked as I had asked the admin Secretary for advise on should I resign as I thought the writing was on the wall as the HR manager does not attend probation reviews for no reason. I had packed my bag in my little office which I shared with my manager and he had seen this and told the gm about it. The gm went on asking why I had packed my bag I said well I thought you was going to sack me I was shocked he even asked me this question at all.Then he said I am terminating your probation and you have the right of appeal and you will get one week pay and then he escorted me from the building it was convenient that the manager was not in the office when I collected my bag.That is the storey so what do you think?

We'd both been at uni in the north of England and moved to Edinburgh.We started working at a small call centre which I helped him buy out and take over.I became a 10% shareholder and director in a company that has grown ever since. In the articles of agreement we agreed that only employees had the right to be shareholders and directors. i took on head of compliance - monitoring recordings to ensure customers wereserviced responsibly, guidelines followed etc.In 2014 my uni friend and I had a disagreement that meant things have been socially cold between usever since. (He left his wife who was also my friend and began an affair with a woman who was a call agent. Moving in together she has been promoted and given shares by him. In a lot of boardroom negotiations with other companies she has taken a place I once occupied. I think he thought I'd taken sides with his ex wife against him which I think I had.)Anyway, my standing in this now fairly large company remained secure but I found I was increasingly frozen out of thesocial side of things - corporate events, charity functions etc at which I was usually at the centre of alongside the uni friend.I remained professional but was not a little hurt by this.Come the end of January acorrective email about compliance misinformation that I sent his now girlfriend was called out by him as\"bullying\". There was no way that it was. Howver the following Friday - the end of January just gone - a rudimentary oversight (an hour of evening's calls not monitored) was called out by him as a dereliction of duty and \"an attempt to bring the company into disrepute\" which I found utterly laughable. He then ramped this up, having our HR head draft a letter notifying me of suspension. I was suspended from work (a company I have shares in and am registered at companies house as a director of) and not to return until a disciplinary hearing to be chaired by him (he is the majority shareholder and managing director) at which I imagine i am to be sacked perhaps.I know of many double dealings and skimming-from-the top he has done over the years but have no evidence of this.

Customer didn't turn up, case was adjourned, didn't turn up again, judgment was awarded in my favour.Judgment was not paid so I applied to the high court who arranged for their enforcement officers to make a visit. The first attempt was unsuccessful and the same with the next visit.The defendants then applied for the judgment to be set aside, the judge dismissed this so enforcement officers made another visit.Then I received a letter from the defendants via the high court detailing various legislation and claiming that they are classed as a vulnerable household due to health issues backed up with a doctor note so any further visits from bailiffs / enforcement officers will be classed as harrassment and they will take action if the visits continue. The high court enforcement agents closed the case!So then, determined not to give up, I applied to the small claims court for an order that the defendants attend court for questioning. On the understanding that the defendants can't ignore this as they would be in contempt of court, I thought maybe I could obtain their bank details this way and the court could then arrange for their bank account to be frozen until he debt had been paid.Anyway I paid for the court order and also paid for the bailiffs service to serve it but the defendants have avoided the bailiffs and they have failed to serve the order and the court date has been and gone.So, where do i go from here? How can I get the order served to them if they just hide behind closed doors, as it has to be personally served this seems impossible!Any other ways I can try to get what I am owed from these people?Thanks all."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "01/02/16 12:52", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "Apologies.

The history is convoluted: Brother took a mortgage with our father to buy their council house, but reneged. Dad worked past retirement until too ill. My husband was a bank manager and able to arrange a mortgage in which each sibling paid \u00a3100 per month. Mum & Dad retained joint ownership. We signed a Deed of Trust that Mum and/or Dad could remain in the property until death, then we would each receive a share of the proceeds of sale, according to how much we had paid in. After a couple of years I divorced so could not continue. My brother and sister did not have to increase their monthly payments or pay longer than expected. Mum inherited a legacy which allowed her to redeem the mortgage and in consequence, she stated in the will that \u00a310k from the proceeds of sale of the property, plus any other residual monies should be equally divided by three. As far as I am concerned that is fair and reasonable - I do not want more than I am entitled to. However the problems began when my brother and sister wanted to keep the property to rent out. At first they asked if I wanted to join in, or have them buy me out. But they refused to give me any figures so that I could decide the best way forward. Eventually it was clear that they would buy me out regardless of my wishes, and proposed to do so at less than market price. I objected, rang a few local agents and happened upon one who had valued the property for probate - \u00a3250k in Nov2013. In July 2014 she would market it at \u00a3280-300k. She said she rang my brother in Jan&Feb 2014 to tell him the price had risen. I suggested to my brother the fairest way was to get three more agents' estimates and settle at average, alternatively put property on the open market then match the best offer. That is when they decided to call in a surveyor (at a cost of \u00a3570 which they deducted from the estate). But of course the bluster about 'buying' the property was a sham, because according to the Land Registry they already owned it.    I called a solicitor who said there was a case, and I could instruct for a fixed \u00a3300 fee, but his handling of it was poor. In response to his letters requesting documentation to support their belated claim that they had transferred the property to themselves as executors, my brother and sister just made accusations that I had delayed the winding up of the estate and they would deduct expenses for the property from my legacy, up until they obtained the loan to pay me a year later. The solicitor would give me advice, then when I asked him to write in accordance with his advice, outlining to the executors my rights as a beneficiary, he would say 'We're not really strong on that'. After 5 months I challenged him because my research on the was not supporting the advice he gave, and he had made no progress at all. He passed the letter to a senior partner who basically replied that there was \u00a31500 of unbilled work and if I didn't take the case elsewhere he would charge me for that and would need a further \u00a31500 for the next step. I had asked about costs throughout and had been repeatedly told that I was still covered by the initial payment- so I had to come to the conclusion that my interests were not best served by this firm and would have to proceed alone. The current situation is that the executors sent a cheque in June 2015 for my share of the value as at October 2014 (\u00a317,391) - the solicitor said it would not be prejudicial to my case if I accepted it. My brother and sister retained equal shares of the remaining\u00a3237,605 equity in the property. However, as stated in my first post the executors have taken all of the residual money as costs of the estate and further reduced my specific third share of the \u00a310k by the costs they say have been incurred. I put forward an offer to the executors in June 2015 to settle for \u00a34390 as the remainder of my legacy and a small amount of interest, without sight of the accounts. They did not respond and since seeing the figures they have provided I have withdrawn the offer - because it is now apparent that they have taken money to which they were not entitled. Still more dubious is their use of my mother's bank cards. They had permission to use them for my mother's shopping, until her death but did not advise the banks until October, that she had died in August. I know that my sister continued to withdraw money from the accounts in the intervening period. Since writing for verification of the accounts a month ago, I have heard nothing. I have sent another letter outlining the amount I calculate would be due to me after the legitimate expenses have been deducted, and suggested I would consider a proposal from my brother and sister based on that. Having been stung by an ineffective solicitor already, I am very wary of incurring costs that I would not be able to recover.

As the weeks went on, my ex and her family began to goad me and slander my name. I felt as if I was being bullied out of the town. After three months of this and not having any family or friends to turn to in the Somerset area, I decided to move back to Yorkshire where all my friends were. In the last year I have had to jump over many hurdles as she has tried to stop me from seeing my kids and after many attempts gave up due to the fantastic work of my solicitor. Irwin Mitchell. We managed to agree a routine much to my exes hate. A week later I had a call from the somerset police to say that a crime had been reported against me. I could not believe it. It seems as though my exes sister had told police I had sexually touched her 4 years ago. When she would have been under age. I was shocked hurt and most certainly did not do anything of a kind. I didn't know where to turn. Days after this I was still maintaining contact with my boys. Then on my birthday in July 2 weeks after the accusation had been made and I had travelled to Somerset of my own free will to give police all they needed I had a letter from My ex stopping all contact at all. No phone no seeing them not even a happy birthday on birthdays. It effected my health I now suffer severe depression and other health conditions as a result. I recently decided to issue court proceedings myself as I am now out of work due to depression and cannot afford to pay my solicitor. At the first hearing my ex was a bully again, and I felt as if the court listened to her and didn't want to take anything into account. Said that I was a danger to my kids and that she was worried I would hurt them too. I have so much evidence to prove the kids are safe and happy when around me. I came away with only allowed to send birthday and Christmas cards not even presents or a phone call is allowed I feel hard done by and I was open to any contact arrangements just to be able to see my boys. I really don't know what to do anymore and I have not seen my boys for 7 months this is not in their best interest.

Regarding the age of the flat - this is in a period building (c. 1850s) and the flat itself as far as I know has been in existence for 30-35 years.

If you require to cross land that is owned by someone else to gain entry to your flat then you need either their permission or a Right of Way. This is basic stuff for a conveyancer ( or it should be).  Any competent practitioner would check their client had a legal means of access either across public land which is usually the case or if across private land that there was an easement ( a legal right to cross). Without a right of access you become a trespasser. The conveyancer should have checked the title to ensure a Right of Way was registered. Where a ROW exists it continues to exist even if the servient property ( the land on which the ROW is situated) is sold. this means tha if your property had the ROW the fact that the pathway was sold does not matter. So the first thing that should be checked is the title. If ( and it sounds as if this may be the case) it is not for some reason registered then the issue needs to be tackled or you will never sell. There may be a simple way out and a Right of Way by prescription may have been created. In plain terms this arises if a route is used continuously for twenty years or more openly, without permission, and without force. So if the pathway has been used for twenty years or more and noone has done anything about it there is the likelihood that the Right of Way by prescription has been created. To prove this you have to make statutory declaration to this effect and serve it on the pathway owner. You can use the time previous owners used the pathway hence it seems a racing certainty that if the flat is 30-35 years old it must have been used for twnety continuous years. It may be just a simple error but obviously a solicitor has picked up on the issue and it needs attention.

This is what my solicitor told me when I first met (its not the matrimonial home etc.) so that's when I moved forward with the sale of the 1st property and bought the second but my ex managed to get her solicitor to put a dispute into the land registry preventing me from selling the property I'm in now , Claiming she had a rightful share because she supported me during the 1st properties restoration and the moneys spent could have gone into the community fund ! but she didn't, apart from some cash part time work . The bank records and credit cards clearly show I was the main provider so far the legal bill is about \u00a34.500 . I've been to the 1st hearing where the judge told us off and to move forward to making offers, my barrister advised me that my pension fund with a transfer value of \u00a354,000 pounds was a potential source of income (myself being 56 my ex being 45 ) of which I could cash in 25% tax free add some money in which I had leftover from the mortgage \u00a311,500 + some cash of my own I should make an offer of \u00a330,000. But my policy holder told me I couldn't cash the 25% in, my pension being in a category that doesn't work that way!! So I went back to my solicitor who said \"we wont make an offer but we'll get the right to buy on the table and offer to relinquish all my rights in that as part settlement\" When we went to court for the second time the judged talked without any regard for the fact the children in the relationship weren't mine saying that the length of the cohabitation made the house community property and threatened that if I or my ex wasn't prepared to negotiate the costs could be assigned to whoever was being the most unreasonable. I made an offer of \u00a322,000 + my car which is worth about \u00a33,000, neither her or her barrister believed that I couldn't get my hands on my pension and said they wouldn't settle for anything less than \u00a332,000 and the car , we went back into the court and the judge was impressed that we had made progress but dismissed to the next hearing ordering me to get up to date valuations on my property and written confirmation from my insurers that the money was not available to me, and that she should get written confirmation from the council as to the cost of the council house - the discount and a separate independent valuation of the property to indicate a true value. He also asked her to get a mortgage proposal to indicate how much money she would need to buy the property, I'm almost certain she wont get a mortgage because she has CCJs against her, Its always been her intention to get as much money as she can out of me then buy the property with a mortgage that is backed up by her rich boyfriend who is paying her legal fees, then probably let the property till the 5 year term is up then cash in.

He pulled off a job soon after starting the works but was paid a 'settlement' amount for the work carried out by the main contractor which was probably less the costs he had incurred.The reason the judgment is against the defendant personally and not his company is because he paid 2 other workers (his friends) their wages in full and therefore my argument is that by paying them and not us he is personally liable for not treating all of his creditors equally in an insolvency situation.The defendant is now currently self-employed and during an order for questioning provided bank account details (the account only had only a few \u00a3 in it though and is unlikely to have the sufficient funds to cover the debt).  He does own a second property that is solely in his name that he did state during the order for questioning he was being paid rent of \u00a3750 for this property.

In the corner I also have a septic tank that has been there I expect for 60 years plus and has never caused a problem.The land behind my garden wall is being developed to housing. Whilst clearing all that land my wall was damaged and ended up collapsing, I was assured things would be put right when eerything was finished, lots of stone was taken no doubt sold on so the remaining I got someone to put well within my boundary where it could not be touched. The builders continued to use the bottom of my garden to put their equipment and took advantage of my land generally.Recently I came home to find where my wooden fence was, it had been removed and a large digger had dug vast holes within my garden to ultimately set a high fence. They dug up trees, and one hole went stright through my soakway for the septic tank...I confronted the builders and they said the land owner of the field said it was his land and he told them to do it.I requested nothing was done until my surveyor met them on site - however a site meeting was held where the builders and land owner surveyors decided where the boundaries were and we had not been invited.Now I find out that they landowner continues to claim his land is withing my garden at the side and now the builders have said that they will be coming over what was my boundary stone wall into my garden and set a fence there.How can I stop this happening - I have many photos and even the deed plans do not show a big step in at the side.

The rent meant that there were 6 of us living in a shared house, and per the contract we were all jointly liable to pay a certain amount every month i.e. \u00a3500 for rent x 6 meaning \u00a33,000. I have had massive difficulties with one particular tenant, who has now left the house. Over the period to June, so coming onto 10 months now, he has had serious issues paying for rent and for bills. Whenever I would try and get hold of him (I work away from the house regularly) he wouldn't answer his phone, until we had to confront him to pay. This has meant that over the course of the 10 months, I have covered nearly \u00a31,200 in rent and bills for him. Often what would happen would be, the deadline for rent would come, and I would speak to him, he would tell me that he needed 2-3 days to pay it, and in order to ensure the landlord was paid on time, I would just pay the whole amount. Then he wouldn't make any effort to pay me. This has happened on 2 occasions, other times the total amount including bills might have been say \u00a3600, but he would only pay me \u00a3450. The point is, that he always said he would pay me back but as it got to month 6-7 I started to realise he was not doing anything for himself (i.e. get a job) to make sure he can pay rent. So I said I would stop helping him. He's struggled for a few months by asking other friends and family for money for rent, and it got the point a few days ago where he said he couldn't come up with the money for our latest rent, so we made a decision that he would need to leave, which he accepted and has done so.I have said to him to come and see me so we can sort out the rest of the money he owes but he has decided to ignore my calls and messages. I have access to \u00a3600 of his deposit money which will halve the amount he owes, but I would also like to chase him for the remaining \u00a3600.My questions are as follows:What would be the best course of action to take regarding this situation? I think it is fair to say now, that even though he has been saying he will pay me back all this time, he doesn't have any intention to do so.The other 4 tenants can and will back me up into saying that while the tenancy says that we are jointly liable, we all made a verbal agreement at the start of the tenancy to say we will all pay in equal amounts every month for rent, and for any bills.I have messages from him saying things like \"I have been working very hard to pay you back\" which shows that I didn't just give him the money, and that he would need to pay it back.I appreciate that the small claims court is something that I would need to consider, is there any advice that anyone can give me on how best to prepare for this case, and any key things that I should consider.Any advice would be much appreciated.

Anyway, I took the car to my local mechanic and straight away he pointed out a slight mismatch on the bonnet where it doesn't line up as flush on one side. Also, if you look very closely in the engine bay you can see signs of cracking, the underneath of the bonnet is black and clearly a replacement bonnet. The car is wrapped in white which I obviously knew when purchasing the car but now I can see why it would have been wrapped, to hide damage on the original colour. Also, it is now showing a light on the dash that the drivers door isn't closed when it actually is, and none of the electricals are working on the drivers side. I'm almost certain that the car has had damage to the front right hand side of the car. To top it all off, the engine light has came on (which is under warranty but I'd rather not keep the car).So, I have spoken to the dealers and all they have said is they will fix the faults but to be quite honest I don't feel safe driving the car, I'd rather just get my money back and spend that kind of money on something in better condition.

Our deposit was \u00a3825.We received a text one Saturday night informing us that our tennancy would end after one year (this is in around March time so we had until July to find another house). We got worried and contacted the council to see if they could help us find another house. One of the options given to us by them was that we could have legally stayed in the house as they could not evict us legally - We have kids and didn't want to do this. The council then contacted our landlord saying we could take them to court and stay (for some reason). She us after angry and upset, but we assured her that we woudln't do this.We found another place and planned to move in in May and we let the landlord know. From this point on we received a lot of pressue from them. Daily texts about what was happening with our other house, stating that the house had to be immaculate for when they go back, etc.. Few weeks down the line... I did more digging and found out about the tenancy protection schemes. At this point we found out that our landlord was ringing all our neighbours finding out what kind of tennants we had been. Alarm bells started ringing and I had the feeling that this could get nasty.I contacted the three schemes to find they had not used a scheme, but I didn't query this with the landlord as I wanted to see what happened with the handover. We moved out on a Saturday and we had previously agreed that we moved meet on Sunday at 12:00 for the handover. The landlord's husband went round to the house on Saturday night and she text me \"The house is empty, have you moved out?\", we said we had, but we wanted the extra day to clean up the house, etc... she wanted to move in that night... We told her no, as previously agreed, it will be Sunday at 12:00. She demanded that I meet her husband that night, but I couldn't as I was out that evening. It was getting nasty and I left it at that then I received a follow up message from her saying how she didn't appreciate 'how I had been with her' simply because we wanted to hand over the house the next day and finish up tidying the next morning.Sunday came. We got a text late morning saying that it will now be 1pm in the afternoon to hand over the house. We agreed and got someone to look after our kids for another hour. We waited until 13:10 before I text her asking that we were short on time and that the kids were being looked after and how long they would be. We got a response \"we will be there shortly\"... At 13:20 they still hadn't shown up and I text her saying we had to leave to get back to the kids. There was no coutesy informing us that they were going to be late and or an actual time as to when they would show up.About 15 minutes later when we picked up the kids and got home I received calls. Bascially shouting down the phone about the state of the house. Carpets hadn't been hoovered, stains on the blinds, dust on cupboards, etc... The house had been thoroughly cleaned by my parents, my partner's, my sister and aunty and one of my friends. The house was in very good condition. On the phone she demanded that we go back and meet her, I informed her of our situation and that she had failed to show up on time - she then hung up on me. I rang her back. As usual she didn't let me get a word in, but I kept asking what scheme she used for our deposit, she hung up on me again. I sent numerous texts and called her numerous times in regards to the deposit scheme all that day but nothing came back.On monday I text her again. I asked what scheme was being used and that I had contacted the schemes and they have informed me that the deposit was not enlisted with them and I would persue this legally as she had broken the law. My partner's parents received a visit from them. She was moaning at my partners parents whilst her husband told her to be quiet and that they should leave. She then proceeded to bring up the death of their daughter - my partner's dad went mental and told them to leave the property immeadiately. I then called her (she answered this time) saying the police will be called if they step foot on their proerty again. After asking about the scheme she used for our deposit she hung up on me again.Enter the fray my landlord's husband's solicitor. He emailed me On the Wednesday that I was n breach of protocol if I had persued it through the courts without sending an action before letter (I had sent the letter on Tuesday and asked him to ask his client to sign ofr the letter that was being help by the Post Office). I told him the story so far, but didn't receive a resposne. I gave them till June 10th to respond. Yesterday, on the 11th, I emailed his solictor informing him that I had not received a response. I got a reply saying that they had emailed me on the 3rd (I had not received this at all), I asked him to attach the email actually sent, but his secratary was away on leave so couldn't prove that it had been sent.... Anyways. In the email was a letter listing numerous damages to the house and scans of receipts/invoices from various cleaning agencys:\u00a370 for cleaning the cooker - my partner cleaned this thoroughly, but the notes on the scan say that there was embedded food on the hobs, glass door and roof of the oven. \u00a323 for a letter box that was already broken. \u00a3255 for steam cleaning the carpets (I had previously text her saying that I would do this on the Sunday we left the house, but she told us not to) She also promised to steam clean the carpets when we first moved in as the previous tenants had a dog, she also came to the house over Xmas and said she would get it done for us, but again, it never happened. \u00a365 for removing mould in ALL the window seals - We were only there 10 months... There was also mould on the bathroom ceiling and the blinds in there that she said would be sorted on a later date when we moved in - but that never happened. The blinds for the patio door were to be replaced when we moved in as they were heavily stained - we were billed for this too. There were a few damages I was happy to pay for... Adding an additional lock to the bathroom (as there wasn't one on there) and the handle for one of the doors.In total, the letter amounted to \u00a3477.95 in damages (our deposit was \u00a3825), but they were happy to setlle for \u00a3250 in damages so the total I'd get back would be \u00a3575. I'm not particualy happy about this sum due to the fact the carpets needed steam cleaning anyway, the oven was definitely cleaned to a good standard and I don't see how we can be billed for mould growing in the window seals if we had only been ther 10 months - plus the fact that there was mould in the bathroom and on the blinds.I know I can take them to court to get my full deposit back as they have broken the law (his solictor confirmed in an email that they had not used one, and it was an oversight on his client's part and wasn't done purposely. I could also be entitled to compensation too.What I'm not sure on his what happens with the damages? I remember going through an inventory which we signed, but we didn't get a copy of that. The tenancy agreement says that no interest will be incurred on the deposit , but doesn't say where it will be held.If I can them to court, and I win my deposit back plus the fees, can they then counter sue me for the damages to the house? I'm sure most of it is exagerated and there's no way we caused that much damage, but they have invoices and receipts. Can they actually take me to court for the damages? If I lose I'd then have to pay for court fees, his solicitor fees, etc which will obviously outweigh the amount of my deposit and would probably exceed the 3x compo I might get also.Or do I just accept the settlement - I'm not happy to do so, but if it avoids a lot of hassle and court hearings, etc, I'd just get it over and done with. But, the landlord has won.Any help will be greatly appreciated. Do I pay for 30 minutes consulation with a solicitor? Will I receive any information from them worthy of \u00a380? I'd spoke to the Citezen's advice bureau, but they just direct me to websites...Sorry for the essay.

I was not taken on any fast roads to test drive said car. Immediatley after driving car away it had problems. The car came with a 3 month warrenty andI also purchased an extended 3 year warrenty. The dealer agreed to fix the issues or atleast tried for a while. The issues related to the car vibrating badly, clutch problems and issues with the wheels. The car ended up with 10 faults which involved me taking the car back and forth to the dealer whilst they attempted to repair said problems (15 visits to the dealer in total), and as one of the issues were the wheels and I ended up doing a lot of running around to have wheels and tyres tested for the dealer. After there 3 month warrenty expired I was tired of the car as the problems were still evident and more were appearing including the cv broke on the front left drive shaft. The dealer advised me that the 3 month warrenty had expired and wasnt really interested.I took the matter up with the finance company and told them thatI wanted to reject the car as it clearly wasnt fit for purpase and thatI had given the dealer ample oportunaties to fix the problems. My request to reject the car fell on deaf ears and eventually I was told by the finance comp that the dealer wanted to have the car examined and that I was to now speak again with them even though I had told them I had lost all faith in the car. On contacting the dealer he asked for a list of problems whichI supplied. The dealer then attempted to say that I had never made him aware of any of the problems (although he had replaced 6 parts due to the issues but failed to resolve them) and that even though my 3 month warrenty was up he would offer two ways to deal with it.I explained to the dealer that I had recordedin writing every phone call, visit to dealer and whyincluding dates and what had happened so how could he state that I had not made him aware. The dealernow will only communicate via email and has now offered the following - 1- to go through the list I had of problems and try to sort them or 2 have the vehicle examined by the cars manufactor and then see what they find and then fix any faults. Either wayI would have to leave the car with him (I.E not take the car myself to the examination). I no longer not only trust the car but also the dealer as he now has startedback trackingabout things. Whats to say he doesnt claim he has had the car examined but doesnt and then says there are no issues. I want to reject the car totally as i do not trust it and worry ifI have to take my baby in it. Not onlythat but it costs a lot to constantlydrive to the dealers. I know that ifI reject it totally I cannot use it which again makes life very difficult. I have already had to take time off work for work tobe done to this car and last week i ended up paying \u00a3150 for a new drive shaft as the dealer told me it was not covered anymore but told the finance company that he offered to repair it as a good will gesture. Sorry for the very long essay but as professionals do you thinkI have a good case for rejecting the car under the sale of goods act and what are my chances ifI take the matter to small claims courtbig big thankyou for your timekind regardsJim"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "21/04/15 15:07", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "You have already had an answer.", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "21/04/15 17:11"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "Hi Kev, Do you still need help with this issue?", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "13/05/15 10:04"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "hi..yes please if you could give me any advice that would be great..I have been advised that they should not recieve legal fees in a small claims but i was wondering if i have a case for fraud because they asked for legal fees for sending me a letter saying i owed them money..thanks  ", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "13/05/15 13:01"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "what do you expect from us?", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "12/06/15 09:32"}], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/have-i-got-case-possible-fraud-0", "1.Init_Post": "Have i got a case for possible fraud if before any legal action took place my exlandlord gave me a bill for \u00a31400 for unpaid rent and added \u00a3450 legal fees to the bill even before any court action was taken..."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "15/05/15 06:07", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "ok thanks for sharing here.

I sold my house to move in with my partner. I shared the house with my Son, the house was half mine and half my ex husbands and we had agreed that i stayed there until my Son was 18. My partner and i had agreed neither of wanted to get married, the issue was discussed extensively and he promised me that he wanted me to move in with him and that i would share in his life as an wqual including in the property. Based on this promise i sold my house and spent the money on my partners house and on family things, not at any point did my partner tell me that i shouldn't spend the money as if we did break up i would not have any entitlement to the house or financial help from him. We had a baby and some of the money went on that as i had to give up work due to a very ill prenancy that i had to have hospital treatment for regualrily. I was on contracts before this and surprise surprise it wasn't renewed after i became pregnant. I also had intended to use some of the money from the sale of the house on going back to university. When my daughter was about 6 months old i applied and was offered a place on a pgce teacher training course. I had to give up this chance of a career as my partner said he couldn't afford to pay the mortgage id i didn't work and couldn't afford childcare. I gave it al up and we agreed that i wuld stay at home and bring up the children, work as a childminder in the house and this would free his time to work unsociable shifts as a police officer and do extra work as a fire arms officer which enabled us to pay the mortgage with my wage as a childminder. We agreed i would do this until he retired in 2020 at which point i could go to university as we would get a lump sum to pay the mortgage and he wouldn't be working shifts/fire arms jobs. Before i turned down the place at university to stay at home as a childminder i questioned his intentions on my security. I wanted to get married and if he wouldn't i would leave and take the place at university. He assured me he would write a will, that i was on all the insurance documents if anything happened to him and that i would be treat equally as a wife should anything happen. He said we didn't need a piece of paper as it woudn't make any difference, that i was his equal whether we are married or not.So i stayed. But some years later he has now decided the relationship is over and i have discovered he never wrote a will.So my question is, can he? Given everything i have put towards paying the mortgage and i sold my secure home to move in with him on his promises. Also my job is in the home i have children on my books until Sept 16. My Son is also being assessed for mental health issues. Mt solicitor says i have undoubably got interest in the property.So if he wants me to leave on the 1st September by 4pm and i don't what happens then? Can he have me arrested or does he have to go to court to get an order.PLease helpIdeally i'd like to stay as i don't want to up root my children, this has been his decision, there has been no affairs or violence etc, he's just gone into shut down. He has moved out to his parents at the moment too.Surely things like this went out with the dark ages, throwing your family out and being able to get away with it. I don't want to go to court because of costs so im just trying to sit tight and hope my solicitor is right.Thankyou for any help, greatly appreciated"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "05/06/15 14:01", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/contract-v-legislation", "1.Init_Post": "Hi.Our freeholder has issued notice intending to enter into a long term contract (24-40 years) for the provision of services related to the operation and maintenance of our district heating scheme, resulting in leaseholders being bound to the supplier for the 24-40 years.Just wondering, DH is currently unregulated.

But I'm really confused about how police acccess rights work now. From all the resources I had found on the internet up until this point, it had seemed like the only difference between a police officer doing his duty and a regular person is that there are a load of situations; a warrant, arresting someone or having arrested someone, preventing a breach of the peace etc. where the police just plain don't need permission to enter, because they have a \"justification by law\" or possibly \"necessity\" defence against trespass. \"License\" defences being different would be puzzling, since who you are doesn't affect whether something has been agreed or not. Implied access rights work by giving someone a \"license\" defence, right? Just by having a front door, you invite anyone who comes by to come to the front door and knock on it to enquire as to the availability of anyone in, and hence extend to them a license to do so, unless you specifically state otherwise, and there's no possibility of the visitor being welcome. It seems really surprising that \"I have a front door but you can't come to it\" should still invite some people even while it doesn't invite most. An invitation or license that you're still giving even though you say you're not giving it seems really weird. \"I have a front door\" invites anyone to knock on it, and \"come in\" then invites anyone to enter. We're saying that \"My front door does not invite you\" still invites the police officer but not the TV license inspector, even though \"You can't come in\" then refuses entry to both? What's the difference between the two licenses? What am I misunderstanding here?

And, (extrapolating,) this protection would expire, in that case of not having statutory powers, once this fact had become clear, but unless you've now told them to go away, they can now remain at least on your doorstep on a \"permission implied by inaction\" basis, due to the absence of an objection?

(For the purpose of talking to me.) They don't seem to care about the law, and keep coming onto my property and trying to ask me questions. No warrant, no suspected crime, none of the special reasons which can grant the police access. They refuse to specify any defence against trespass. Since they're trying to make me answer questions instead of doing whatever I was doing, they are attempting and succeeding in disrupting my activities, so I think this counts as the minor crime of aggravated trespass.I reported the officers through the complaints system once I'd recorded them on my laptop webcam. It was classified for local resolution, and quickly abandoned, concluding it hadn't happened (they would only come in if you invited them, the issue of access to the front door was ignored) without asking for evidence.I appealed, amongst other things questioning the use of local resolution and objecting to my evidence not having been asked for or viewed. The appeal result utterly ignored my claims to have evidence, and specified illegal reasons to justify local resolution; that it didn't meet the threshold for IPCC referral and wasn't subject to special requirements, which is contrary to the Police Reform Act 2002. The test required by the law is whether, if it was true, it would justify disciplinary or criminal action, which I think should be true of knowingly and repeatedly committing minor crimes. (And even if I'm wrong about it being aggravated trespass, that would still mean the appeal needed to go to the IPCC, instead of being handled by the constabulary.)Further complaints were designated \"local resolution\" then seemingly forgotten, nothing heard since initial recording. They're going to come again soon, still witholding any defence against trespass.So...My plan is to sue the police (the Chief Constable) for trespass in the small claims court. Get damages and an injunction. And then ask the professional standards department why nothing is happening on complaints where the police have been found guilty in court. But...1) Anything obviously wrong with this plan? I think injunctions against trespass are available even in small claims, but I do wonder whether a judge might not want to give the police an injunction preventing them from trying to do their jobs, even if it's clear they're doing it illegally and intend to keep offending.2) What level of damages would I want to ask for? Since there's no property damage, it would seem to start as \"nominal\", but then there are huge aggravating factors, which leaves it really unclear. (I don't really care about getting money, but I want to do it properly, rather than \"letting them off\".)3) I know you're supposed to start off by demanding the damages out of court.

Filing a trademark with the Principal, or primary, Register will grant you national recognition and protect you from infringement throughout the United States. Registering on the Supplemental, or secondary, Register, however, will only protect your mark as far as your common or state law. Nonetheless, holders of marks filed under the Supplemental Register may still sue for trademark infringement, if they so choose. A business also has the opportunity to register a trademark based upon their planned use for it in the future, even if they are not using it in commerce at the time they register. According to Schulte, filing an 'Intent-to-Use' application will keep your mark 'pending until you show you use it.' In order to qualify for 'Intent-to-Use,' a business must plan to use the mark in commerce, and file an Allegation of Use statement, which allows a 30-day opposition period where other businesses may claim that your proposed mark is 'confusingly similar' to their own. If your trademark is deemed unique, your application process will be 'Approved for Publication,' and you will have to wait for a 'Notice of Allowance' to be issued until you can officially use your trademark.While many business owners hire attorneys like Schulte to assist in registering trademarks to ensure that their marks pass the test of uniqueness, he says that businesses have the option of researching themselves, as well.

The post-98 Credit Agreement makes it clear in Section 6 that they have to send notice out, but the pre-98 CA is more wooly, merely referring to how they have the right to determine the dates, and from this one can infer that therefore they have an obligation to tell the account holders of their determination.However, they have clearly created a convention of sending these notices to account holders over 25 years, and as there is no obligation to the account holder to request a deferral notice, it just got me wondering about \"convention\" in law and what force it has.Regards, H"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "20/04/15 01:24", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "Been there, got that T-shirt.

Its been four weeks, a builder has come round several times and stated until the leaks stopped (its dripping constantly still through 3 light sockets that have been disabled) they can't do anything, once that occurs they wil be able to bring in dehumidifiers and then survey the damage to the ceiling and walls before carrying out repairs.My argument is that its been four weeks, the lounge feels damp constantly, my clothes take forever to dry in there (no where else to have a clothes dryer) and having only 1/4 lights working is just damn irritating. If it had been my own leak, my own insurance would have resolved this within days, isolating the leak, and repairing all damage and bringing in heaters/dehumidifiers straight away. I've had to have heating on when it's not really needed (downstairs have theirs on all the time so heats my flat) just to try dry out the room so it doesn't feel damp.

However I will give you an indication based on the facts that you have disclosed as to a course of action that could benefit your mother. There seems to be just two major obstacles but in effect they amount to the same. Firstly I gather your father is still on the legal title. Secondly the receivers are after what they claim is his share. As there is \u00a326000 at stake she will need to spend some money on trying to defend her situation. It should not be very expensive but it is unlikely she would be able to deal with it without legal assistance if a court hearing was required. I suggest you approach the receivers and see if they will cooperate with the suggested course of action. This is to seek a declaration from the court (Part 8 procedure) as to whether your father had any beneficial interest in the property at the date of his bankruptcy. If nothing else it is a strong bargaining position as I think it likely the court would find in her favour if there are no significant facts omitted. The very fact that you are indicating you will go down this route may persuade the receivers to back off. Part 8 is what is known as an alternative procedure and is used when (unlike most court cases ) there is no dispute of fact. In your situation there are unlikely to be any factual disputes. It seems in effect your father deserted your mother in 1998 and made no further financial contribution to the property. These facts are not in dispute. In other words  by his actions he appears to have abandoned any interest or obligation in it. So the legal question is: does he have any remaining beneficial interest in the property. The law of equity would almost certainly find that in those circumstances he could not simply come back years later and try to claim an interest. As the only ground the receivers have is entirely dependent upon him having a beneficial interest, if a court decides he did not then their claim would also fail. This is not a matter of mathematics , the court will decide on the basis of equity ( fairness). Should a man who walks out on his family be able to return after 14 years and still claim a financial interest when he has made no contribution since leaving.

The house in question has a mortgage of \u00a380,000 but was valued at \u00a3215,000 leaving \u00a3135,000 equity.Due to the fact that my mother had been constantly maintaining the upkeep of the house, including new bathrooms, kitchen, fittings and fixtures etc, and been the sole payer of the mortgage, my father's stake in the house was valued at \u00a326,000.The receivers want to know the action required within 14 days, but seem to be insinuating that they will force her to sell the house to raise the money.A couple of questions:1) Is my father under any financial obligation to pay this as he is now out of bankruptcy?2) Can they actually force the sale of the house?I have spoken to a friend who practices law but isn't a specialist in this area, and is pretty confident the answer to question 1 is yes, and the answer to question 2 is no, but I wondered if anyone could shed any further light on this?Thanks ."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "25/03/15 16:50", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "Why don't you just apply to the court for an order for sale?

In terms of the ferry, you're right to mention the opportunity cost and, if travel companies were not able to over-book their seats (i.e. I pay for a particular seat on the way out and on the way back and that's it - the company cannot sell that seat again), I'd agree with you.  However, these companies don't operate in that way - if I'm early, I can usually just get the next ferry (within limits and provided there's space on that ferry).  Conversely, it has happened where I've been booked on a ferry but it's been too busy and so I've been bumped to the next one. Bearing in mind the companies do operate in this way, what I've done by not turning up for the return leg is provided the ferry company to fill that space with a paying customer.  The one and only single opportunity cost I can see is that they were hoping to sell me something onboard (in the shop or the cafes or the bureaux).  However, since this definitely wasn't made clear in the Ts & Cs, this cannot form part of the contract. As I've said, I definitely broke that particular Term in the contract between us.  My point is that the Term is an Unfair one because it basically says that if the customer takes less of a service from the provider than was agreed (and has paid for), this will result in a higher payment being due.  And so, because of the lack of a consequential loss, I believe this cannot constitue a legal Term.  And really I wanted to get an opinion on that.

You are right, it isn't an Unfair Term but I do think think it's an unfair Term.  I am offered the option of buying a more expensive single ticket, it's true.  The question is, what rational person would pay more for less?  And, frankly, what business is it of anybody (including the supplier) how much of a good or service I take, up to the amount I've paid for?

Fair enough - I have broken the Terms and Conditions.However, my argument is that by not returning the ferry company has not lost anything. In fact, they have gained an economy in their fuel consumption, reduced the wear and tear on their ferry, have not had to employ anyone to load and unload me and haven't had to pay for anyone to check my documentation.So I have two questions....1. Bearing in mind the company has suffered no loss, are they entitled to enforce the contract and charge me the \u00a318?2. Is the term as laid out by the company an Unfair one (in the legal sense)?I guess one of the reasons they offer the day-trip return rate is that they're hoping that someone will buy something on-board on the return journey.

However, it looks as though, the proposed repayment does not take this into consideration. I think the situation is 3 of those, and 2 dozen of the other - my overall standpoint though is that the whole process of working in this business cost me money, and the credit card usage should in most ways cover off money that I believe is owed to me, and compensation for resigning and handing my share back for no reward after 2 years of effort contributing to it's profit.

Let me explain.Recently there was an issue where as a passenger in my own car a group of people where watching us traveling towards them. They left it to the last moment and walked out purposly causing the driver to make a sudden stop resulting in injury to myself and two children under 4 years old. The driver rightly asked wht the hell they where playing at with both babies sat ibn the back of the car crying hysterically. One began to be verbally abusive and attempted an assault by spitting towards the open window of the drivers. This resulted me jumping out of the car and a heated verble confrontaion ensued. When I got back in the car the one I was arguing with who turned out to be a young mouthy lad was taking pictures of the car.Jump forwards a few weeks the driver gets a call from the police asking if they could go and see her? They asked who the passenger was? If the car was hers as they got her details of an add on the back of the car and so had no idea if she had any knowledge. She was confused untill they mentiond the altercation with the youth she only realised when they told her an accusation had been made against the passenger I.E. myself. They then asked her what had happened so she freely gave a statement of event stating that at no time did she witness me assault anyone.They then tell her they need to speak with me and hear my side of the story.I get a visit inviting me to a formal interview tomorrow now here's my problem and question.I am fully aware that this interview is not about me showing my inocence but a tool for the police to build and present a case to the CPS.The police had no idea that the female was driving the car they didn't even have details of the car except an advert number which they phoned that advert could have been on a number of cars however they then gave here confidential information IE the accusation.They also asked her what had happened so now they have a statement from a witness I would have called actually vindicating me.So as they say anything I say can and will be used against me so answering any questions tomorow would efectively make me a third party I cannot give a full personal statement of events as it has already been corrupted by my daughters statement.The police obviously didn't take a formal statement off her so can deny the conversation however I cannot now give a 1st party statement.All I can do is explain what I am aware of and give the statement through my daughters eyes as why would I be a witness against myself when the police already have a full true statement I am not going to give the police anything they can twist.Aside from the obvious failure of confidentiality which has corrupted the polices case.

Basically, her grandmother had just passed away and she had been drowning her sorrows by drinking a large amount of wine and was clearly worse for wear. I spotted the signs of inevitable sickness coming on so promptly ordered a taxi. When we got back to the hotel she went crazy saying she wanted to end it all and locked herself in the hotel room. I then heard glasses smashing behind the door and all sorts of destruction going on in the room. Luckily I found the porter to let me into the room and I found her in a corner curled up in a ball.We took her downstairs and sat her on a seat in the empty bar with a bottle of water in an effort for her to come to her sense as little. All calmed down, so the porter and hotel staff left us alone in the closed bar and we talked for a while. I then got up and went to the toilet. When I came back from the toilet she had climbed over the bar somehow and helped herself to another bottle of wine (basically stole it). I took the wine off her and she went crazy saying that if I didn't give her the wine back, then she would scream the place down. I refused so she started to scream \"help help somebody help me I'm being attacked!\"Obviously complete nonsense but the hotel staff called the Police (don't forget at this stage our room was wrecked and the incident has been going on for an hour) and we were both arrested and taken to the station for questioning.Luckily there was a CCTV camera in the bar with sound that had captured everything. Or nothing as the case was, so they let me go a few hours later and advised me (off the record) to find somebody new, as they know from experience that people who do thing like this (i.e. basically unstable) don't just do it once \u2013 it can happen over and over.So as you can imagine, I left her and never returned. It was the single most bizarre experience of my life.Fast forward 4 years and I'm driving through Liverpool and get randomly stopped in my car due to my left headlight not working. Luckily I had a replacement in my glove box, however the Police office while checking my insurance etc.. Asked if I had ever been in trouble with the Police before. To which I replied \"no of course not\"He then asked if I had ever been to the Lake District before, or ever been in a fight.Obviously I released what he was referring to and couldn't believe there even a trace of something linked to my name like that incident. I did nothing wrong and was released and even apologised to hours after it happened, so why is it still there? Especially him being able to access it so easily due to a faulty headlight.Fast forward another 2 years, so 7 since the \"incident\" in total, and I have an interview with a local school to work in there IT section. As per usual they will request a background check on any person they deem suitable for position.

Thankfully, so far, it has not affected my realtionship with the children.Anyway, the call was fine and I feel we made progress and for the most part managed to agree on a few things that may be very productive.However, after the call ended I hung up and for the first time ever, I was victim to 'pocket dialling'. Basically my iPhone screen did not lock and recalled the last person (my ex). At this point the phone was in my pocket and I was relaying details of the previous call to my long term partner (some of which refered to legal comments/arguments etc with regards to a future case). Some comments may not have been very positive.... but I did speak about some legal issues and concerns I had.When I next pulled my phone out of my pocket some 19 minutes later, I could see the 'green bar' at the top highlighting an active call. I tried to talk into the phone to get the atention of my ex but I could hear some fumbling and then the phone being put down (typicall beep beep beep sound).I realised immediately that the entire conversation with my partner had been being listened too.My question is, do people think that this crosses a legal line with regards to being 'illegal', 'snooping'etc?I fully understand that it was 'my phone' that called the other party however it has to be said that at some point a 'conscious decision' had to have been made to continue listening in and for that reason, without sounding biased, I feel that the actions became illegal at that point.I have been told by my eldest that she had became aware at the time that her mom (my ex) had been listening in to a call and thay she had kept telling them (my children)to ' go away' and be quiet.Although not exactly the same, to find something in the street and make a conscious decision not to return/report it becomes 'theft by finding' at the time the decision is made to retain the item/goods.It should take between 10 - 30 seconds to be fully aware the call was not a live or intended call.... perhaps a minute at the most.Illegal?

Consequently the burden of a contract cannot in principle be transferred without the consent of the other party, so as to discharge the original contractor. As Sir R. Collins M.R. said in Tolhurst v Associated Cement Manufacturers Ltd [1902] 2 KB 660, 668: 'Neither at law or in equity could the burden of a contract be shifted off the shoulders of a contractor on to those of another without the consent of the contractee.'\" ((paragraph 19-077)Chitty on Contracts).However in Jones v Link financial , it was ruled that for Consumer Credit agreements both rights and duties are \"passed\" to the assignee. I have searched Goode and still found no definite answer (although he says theres a drafting error) to my question, so I will ask here:The CCA 1974 gives special powers for an assignor to transfer his obligations to the assignee without the consent or the borrower (creating a carbon copy). However, nothing I have read confirms whether or not the assignor is actually discharged from his original burden after the assignment. One view is that (even after legal assignment by notice) until such time as the borrower agrees, the assignor remains joint and severally liable (along with the assignee) for the duties/obligations. My idea is illustrated here (not uk law):Is there any case or evidence where a legal assignor under the CCA was sued by a debtor for failing to perform?Could someone please explain why the assignor is discharged without the borrowers consent?It seems to be accepted practice that the assignor under s.82A CCA 1974 can discharge himself by assigning away his liabilities. He could assign all his burdens to a bogus assignee as a way to get off the hook. I seems unfair to the borrower so I do not understand. The question may rest on the true meaning of the word \"pass\" in the description of creditor in s.189 CCA 1974.I think the word \"pass\" does not preclude a duplication of duties, but I would really like an expert opinion as I got no reply in the advice thread.Many thanks"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "17/12/14 16:58", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "They are two separate and distinct agreements, one between her and the bank and two between you and her.

If anyone could comment with any suitable advice, I would be more than appreciative!1st - We are currently under a section 21 for no other reason than we do not have a guarantor (had to pay 6 months up front) and the maintenance costs of recent breakages including our boiler, a radiator and the bathroom basin taps. We were told that if we came to an agreement with the landlady we could stay and she was very friendly and fine with the fact we had no guarantor in person but now doubts our capability of paying rent even whilst we've proven we have more than enough of an income including benefits. We know for a fact that a member of Belvoir! (our housing agency) was \u2018referencing' parts of our emails to her and this would not have put us in the best light but was not in complete context. We have had these maintenance issues for months now and because of it, I have denied all viewings whilst we are still here but now they're claiming they can sue for loss of earnings and keep continuously telling us we are meant to allow viewings (of course I know this but considering the tenancy condition decided otherwise). We would really like to stay and only have a month left with no other options for housing, our time here has affected our health due to mould and dampness as well as our sleep as the boiler now \u2018roars' at well over 85db for periods up to 5 minutes. Does anyone have any advice that may put us in a better position or know of anything that may help boost the landlady's confidence, regarding our rent payment? Oh, I have just found out that Belvoir! has been holding all rent, so the landlady and agency employees believe we owe \u00a31050, which we have already paid previously.2nd \u2013 My flatmate now lives with me as her previous boyfriend was not only physically abusive both sexually and violently but also very manipulative and mentally disempowering. Although we have had 8 or so months with no incident or communication, he is now skulking around our area trying to find out where we live claiming stupidly embarrassing things along the lines of \u2018I have people tracing your IP, I have people following you, I know where you live etc.' Previous to the 8 months he attacked me in public and stalked us like crazy, claiming he's going to ruin our live. Of course, now he's back we're worried about hiding our address and he's literally skulking our street and local store. What is it I should have done?3rd \u2013 This one is slightly more extreme than the previous, an uncle of my girlfriends suffers from severe brain damage, bless him, but is sending constant abuse to family and stated several times that he's given people at the hostel my girlfriend's Mum's address and that they would attack her and everyone inside (which includes a child). We have let the hostel no to no prevail, he continuously sends abusive messages and has even noted something to do with an \u2018Islamic threat', of course we take everything said with a pinch of salt but still a concern right? He is most definitely in need of a safe haven and professional help but we have no idea how to proceed? Currently ignoring these messages and threats as well as letting the police know, is doing nothing to help us and the grief from all three of these issues is becoming too much.  I know my questions are vague and I will return to add more content when asked for, I am looking for the most professional and efficient process of eliminating these life problems.

He is 24 years old and started at a coffee shop as a supervisor and was made manager within 2 months of being there. He has received insufficient management training, and recently been dismissed after 19 months due to something he was not trained on or made aware of by the owner or HR manager after 17 months! Is this an unfair dismissal? I will write a small brief below;A year ago James was put in charge of tips which continuously went missing in the work place. James asked the owner if he could look after these tips out of the premises he said yes, he also informed the HR manager, we went out for a xmas party at the end of last year and no issues were raised. In January they asked James what is happening with this years tips, he told them that he will look after them again at home, they said that was fine. They asked AGAIN about 6 months ago and said that it was fine. They both asked James on both occasions, and didn't dispute it.The day before James's holiday (3 weeks ago), Wendy (HR manager) asked if he could bring the tips in, James said that was no problem. She was slowly trying to take his job as James simply didn't have the time or as much knowledge about management as she did. James returned from his 10 day holiday and forgot about tips for nearly a week, and was reminded by Wendy, he apologized and continuously asked when she is next in, so then he could ensure the tips went directly to her. On Thursday 6th November he brought the tips straight into work as he was continuously being pestered for them by now. To his luck, she was in. He handed them straight over to her, and said that there should be \u00a3200 and there was. While he finished apologising and was about to leave, they asked for a log. James was confused as to what they meant by a log, and they suddenly kicked off having a go at him as to why no log was kept on how much tips was made every day. They also mentioned that team members are constantly asking them about tips, and don't trust him. This was new to him as he had got along with every team member very well, not one person had asked him about tips since the owner and Wendy last asked 6 months ago. He questioned why the team members who were asking about tips were not sent his way, the owner and Wendy both replied saying that they were. But they didn't take it upon themselves to inform James about it, and them team members didn't go to him with their query at all. He also explained to Wendy and the owner, that those team members who didn't know he was in charge of the tips either;a) Did not turn up to team members. Team meetings were used as a way of building up trust and friendship upon the team as well as regular updates on how the business was performing, customer feedback and training. Tips were also mentioned in every meeting, so the team members who are questioning Wendy and the owner had not attended these team meetings which were on a 1-2 month basis.b) The team members were obviously not informed regarding the tips during their induction which Wendy was now in charge of. When James was in charge of everyone else's inductions they were informed of tips being put into the jar and not their pocket and that James handles them, and give updates on a monthly basis in the meetings. This was obviously not being mentioned with Wendy doing the teams inductions now.James had now been dismissed for simply not having a log of how much tips they made everyday.He has not been dismissed for taking cash out of the premises as he had both the owners permission and the HR managers permission. But he has been dismissed for Gross Misconduct for simply not making a log on a day to day basis. Something he was unaware he had to do. James was not trained appropriately as a manager that this had to be done, this is his first ever managers role. It was not brought up the previous times that they inquired about the tips. To him this feels very unfair, he has had no disciplinary or any way of appealing.Has he been victimized with this being seen as the only way to push him out of the company?Should he of received sufficient training covering this?Is this an unfair dismissal simply for not making a log?After going through his contract nothing can be seen about taking Cash off of the premises OR anything about tips. Infact nothing about logs is in the contract at all!He is aware tips need to be taxed which is declared at the end of the year as a whole.Any help on this would be greatRegards"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "15/11/14 19:16", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "Pay it back.

I'm desperate for some help on this and thank you in advance of any advice or direction you can provide. I'll outline as much detail as I can below - if I've missed anything please just askThe case relates to a claim being made against my partner (JD) who is a self employed plasterer , and myself, for poor workmanship. The claimant , a customer of ours who JD did lots of work for in Dec 2013, now claims the work is sub standard and will costs \u00a32000 to correct. He has refused JD permission to revisit or re-inspect the alledged problem areas in the house and submitted his claim via MCOL. This is the timeline so far -10/3/14 - MCOL recvd from claimant. Subsequently allocated to small claims track28/4/14 - our directiosn questionnaire submitted to court requesting mediation. Claimant refuses mediation27/5/14 - court confirms case is suitabel for mediation & advises of hearing date on 11th AugustNo evidence or detailed papers received from claimant during interim period7/8/14 - 2 working days prior to hearing court confirms to us that cliamnat has NOT submitted any papers. If he arrives in court the case will be dismissed. We decide to submit an N244 to dismiss case ourselves as neither court nor ourselves have received claimant file. We live in France and choose not to travel to court11/8/14 - hearing date. Nothing heard from court until after hearing. Turns out the court made an error and the claimant HAD submitted his papers but they had recorded it incorrectly on the system, hence the direction they were giving us. District Judge rules for an adjournment to allow claimant to send us papers.11/8/14 - claimant emails to confirm our French address.28/8/14 - court order received advising of second hearing on 24/96/9/14 - claimant's papers finally received, 25 days after the first hearing & 13 working days before 2nd hearing.12/9/14 - our defence pack is posted back. we rush to collate it to ensure timelines are met. we are left with very little time to properly respond and organise return trip to the UK. we choose to include a letter requesting the court hear our side in our absence as we cannot afford the return costs or organise our family situation to enable us to travel24/9/14 - 2nd hearing. Judge finds in favour of claimant.29/9/14 - on advice from court, we submit N244 to set aside the order17/10/14 - email received from court advising that the original order issued was incomplete and a whole 2nd page was missing. It rpovided reasons for the judge's decision which we had not seen before now. revised version of the original order issued 17/10. Direction from court is that we have to apply for permission to appeal in the appellant court/circuit court and submitt a further form and fee.20/10/14 - deadline for payment of original order. claimant contacts us for payment.20/10/14 - second complaint raised with court over another miscommunication which has caused further distress and confusion. they advise that the pay deadline of the original order still stands (i.e. the first one issued in Sept even though half of it was missing and it took 4 weeks for them to realise & reissue)Our first issue is that the Court itself has caused significant delay and confusion on this case just by their own administrative errors and miscommunications.Our seconnd issue is that we regret not making the trip to attend the original hearing in person as we strongly believe the claimant's case was quite flimsy but that the judge took his side more as he was there in person and we were not. Hence we're wanting to go down the appeal road and try and get in front of the judge in person.Specific technical queries -i) claimant alledges lots of poor plastering work done by JD. But refused to allow JD the opportunity to revisit the house and assess for himself and/or rectify.(contrary to Supply of Goods and services Act) The Claimant submitted no photographic evidence of poor plastering on walls/ceilings.Just a \"statement\" from a managing director of a building firm (not a plasterer) who stated he thought it would cost \u00a3x to correct. The statement wasn't even in the correct format as required by the court. We submitted a number of our own photos of the rooms in question which clearly showed a clean job but these seem to have been ignored by the courtii) we have emails from the claimant, received before the job was completed, saying how pleased he was with JD and his work and that he would be happy to leave a review online for him. these were submitted in defenceiii) JD has loads of genuine, positive on-line customer reviews on sites like Rated People. These were submitted in defence but overlooked. The point being that he is not a \"cowboy\" builder. If the allegations of his work were true then surely he wuld never be able to sustain the high level of feedback over a 12 month periodiv) The claim was made against both JD and myself as co-defendants. This was because I referred to myself in emails to the claimant as JD's \"business partner\" in that I manage all his paperwork, communications and admin. It was a metaphorical term and not factually the case, JD is self employed & his business is registered with HMRC as a \"trading as\", not a legal partnership. We rejected that I was personally involved as (a) I never attented the property (b) am not a plasterer and did no work at the house & (c) the business is a sole trader not a partnership - but this was rejected also ??The judges comments were as follows -\"found against both defendants. whilst it was denied that the 2nd defendant was a business partner of the 1st she in fact held herself out as having such a status in correspondence. Therefore both jointly and severely liable\"...how can that be when his business is structured as a sole trader. All I did was handle his emails for him!Judge \" Under rule 27.9 took in to account the defendants evidence in their defence but ultimately assessed the evidence of the claimant who attended> i found him to be truthful and credible> therfore claimant succeeds on balance of probabilities\"If anyone out there can add any comments we'd be extremely grateful. At the moment we're at the stage of considering the appeal application to try and get in front of the judge ourselves or...appointing a solictor in the UK to represent us as we feel that they would be able to undermine much of what has been presented by the claimant. i think it was our error of judgement in not attending the hearing as we were unable to question or challenge/counter challenge specific points in the papers and it is doubtful that the judge will have absorbed all of our pack on our behalf"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "20/10/14 12:34", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "Try the Legal Ombudsman: http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "21/10/14 11:52"}], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/claiming-compensation-solicitors", "1.Init_Post": "Hi,How do I go about claiming compensation from a solicitors firm?I used a certain firm for the purchase of my home years ago.

We have spent MANY years (decades) getting to the stage where people, (men, women and children), who have been abused or assaulted, feel that they can speak up, and get the perpetrators punished for their actions, even when such actions are historical. It often takes guts and determination for people to stand up and say 'this person assaulted me', and for you to sympathise with the perpetrator (not alleged anymore) is horrendous, particularly since you think that 'he was only doing what every other man was doing'...not every man. Most men were keeping their hands to themselves and not letching after people who wouldn't have touched them with a barge pole, or were too young and naive to be able to defend themselves against men who held power and were able to wield that power over others to make them keep their mouths shut over what was happening. Lechery is not 'entirely normal', back then, now, or back in the 1800s...people did not like it whenever it happened, but men in power were able to get away with it. Now, they can't. That's something to be celebrated, not denigrated with a catch all (and manifestly incorrect and unjust) statement that implies 'every other man' was doing the same thing.  That is not a justification for wrong-doing...and for that to come from a woman is an even bigger tragedy. Don't justify people's poor behaviour. 40+ years ago, homosexuality was a crime - 60+ years ago men were marrying girls barely in puberty (and in some countries in the world, still do!) - these things were not right, just because they appeared to be 'legal', or because 'lots' were doing it.  They were wrong, they are wrong, and they will remain wrong. Just like this sexual perpetrator who now, rightfully, has a conviction against him for his offence. That he lost money fighting his case is just. If he's 'broken', like David says, he's putting a bloody good front on it.

The force of this caused yvonne to fall into the radiator in the hallway, with Christina appearing to stumble slightly forward so that she was stood over her. Yvonne stood back up and christina appeared to raise her hands again. Fearing that yvonne may be assaulting again. I grabbed hold of christina by the arms and pushed her towards the front door. Christina pushed me back, so that she could get to the livingroom to get her children.

How did you know that it hadn't been cleaned for 3 years?, did the landlord tell you?. If so, why did the landlord accept it in such a horrendous condition from the previous tenants and not get it cleaned himself?, yet expect you to leave it spotless?. Did you not inspect it prior to signing the tenancy agreement?, if not, why not?. If, as it appears, it was so unsatisfactory on inspection, why did you take it in the first place with such a young child? although I acknowledge I do not know the full story. Did the landlord pay for the cost of the cleaning?.  As to boxes, as one must assume that you had vacant possession, although the place might have needed a good clean, I fail to see why you could not put the boxes in the flat anyway and saved yourself trouble and 100 sovs to boot!.  As to the electricity, The meter is the responsibilty of the electricity supply company and, as the occupants, I would consider that it was your responsibilty to contact them.  In any event, even if a meter failed (I have never heard of one completely failing yet). it would not cut off the electricity. The problem was probably with the trip fuse box. I cannot comment about this as I do not know the details, but if this was the reason, it should have been fixed. In any event, I would still consider you responsible for the damage although as I mentioned in my previous post, get the cleaning company to pay, they owe you a duty of care not to damage anything whilst doing their work.

We viewed the flat while there was a tenant aready there, so the mould was not visible and there did not seem to be any problems although of course it is very difficult to tell when there is someone else's belongings and furniture everywhere! The flat looked lovely and we were not told of any mould problems or anything at all so naturally, we did not think there would be any problems. When we moved into the flat in May, the flat had not had a professional clean by the landlord (which he is contracted to do in the contract as i am sure you know already) so before we even started living there, he was in breach of his contract. This was very frustrating. With regards to the vans with the boxes? We were living with my parents for the month prior to moving into the flat as it wasnt available for a month after we vacated our previous flat so we needed a stop gap. The van had picked up the boxes from my parents house which is 30 miles away from this flat, at 10am. We went to collect the keys at 8:30am and got to the flat at 8:45am to inspect flat and do inventory as the landlord decided to provide one himself rather than get a professional. Speaking of the inventory, half the items were not listed on it and there were A LOT of additional things..It took us ages to complete the inventory which he should have done after the last tenant moved out (which he also failed to do as he did the check out whilst the previous tenant was still in the flat which we ound to be extremely odd as how on earth could he tell it was clean and everything was fine if the flat wasn't vacant?!). When we arrived (and we have lots of photo evidence for this), the flat was FILTHY. I mean filthy. We were expecting our 6 month old daughter to arrive that afternoon and I was not having her in that flat when it was so horrendously unclean. This meant we had to call our landlord, call Townends to try and sort it out to which our reply was that they couldnt arrange anyone to come and clean it until tomorrow meaning more hassle for us. Eventually after a furious call to head office, they arranged cleaners to come over at 10pm to clean meaning we had to roam around the streets of Guildford for 3 hours for them to finish the clean at such a silly time although we were SO greatfull to the lovely cleaners who came over so late. They assured me that this flat had not had a good clean for 3 years which was the total duration of the previous tenants occupation funnily enough! *sigh* The landlord insisted it was the previous tenants fault and that he was furious she hadn't carried out a clean however surely he should have done one after her before WE moved in as the contract states? And obviously this messed around the movers who then had to be delayed which they fined us for quite rightly as they turned down other jobs to do this for us and they had been messed around as we had no idea when this clean was going to happen until later in the afternoon (yes thats how long it took to get a response from landlord...). It was disgracefull and started the tenancy on a terribly bad note. With the mould, we noticed the mould creep in around July. Few months after we moved in. We notified our landlord about it and he insisted we get a dehumidifyer. This would be a good suggestion if it wasn't for our daughter who has suffered quite badly with Croup which as you may or may not know is a potentially serious condition involving the breathing which is aggrivated by dry air so it is vital that there is moisture in the air for her. So unfortunately that was not an option. We did everything we could, venting the flat out every day to try and help prevent it from happening but unfortunately after an inspection from a contracter, he informed us there was no insulation in the walls or cieling (the mould was all over walls and ceiling) and this was why it was happening as it was an old building. Personally I think that this flat should not be available for families with young children as it is not legally fit for purpose. Because we are good tenants we did not go to environmental health and we gave landlord benefit of doubt and let him take his time organising something to be done. This work did not get carried out until January and this meant I had to move my family away back to my mums for 2 weeks. This meant having to pay for travel to and from work and nursery for 30 miles which you can imagine cost a fortune and landlord wouldnt pay for it. My partner is a chef so that meant very long hours and then travel on top which is also very stressfull for him. It was a nightmare. But at least the work was being done (this was installing 3 radiators one in bedroom two in living room). The mould got better afterwards however unfortunately still proved to be a small problem, still appearing on the walls but no where near as bad which was acceptable. The electricity meter! Well. When the electrics went out and wouldnt come back on like the used to by flipping the switch outside, I was on hold for 2 hours to get hold of EDF to have an emergency technician come over and take a look. This also meant my daughter who was currently sleeping in the cold (i left it as long as i could) had to be collected in the middle of the night and taken to my mothers house 30 miles away, poor baby. I left landlord a message to let him know what was going on so i DID sort it out myself as I knew it was up to us to get in touch with EDF, plus this was 10pm so didn't want to disturb landlord unless neccesary. Eventually at 1am the technician arrived and after thourough inspection advised us to get it replaced as it was installed incorrectly. Apparently (im not technician so im not sure the technical names) there are 3 switches that it needs to be wired up to in order to accomodate the electrics in the flat. All the other flats meters were connected to all three switches however ours was only connected to 1 hence why our electrics were tripping. We were obivously shocked at this and wanted it sorted out, we couldnt have the electrics tripping with a baby in the flat. We let landlord know as this was his responsibility to sort out as it clearly says in contract that you must not alter or tamper with electric meter without consent of lanlord. So, I did what I was meant to do and let him know all our account details as he wanted to ring them himself and check that what we were saying was true or not. We also made sure we had the technican write down the problem, sign and date it as proof whch is assured landlord was available if he wanted to see. This was in October. We have not heard anything since and we have now moved out. You cannot tell me that he is not in the wrong here! These things I have mentioned are all basic requirements of living and this flat is not fit for purpose. Like I have said previously we were extremely good tenants and just wanted a safe, clean flat to live in and we did not have this from the day we moved in. This is why I am very reluctant to pay anything for this radiator as 1) its not on the inventory and as this is strictly a business agreement between landlord and tenant, it should be treated as such. and 2) I feel we have been through enough and feel if anyone should pay for anything, we should be payed for all the inconveniences we have experienced because of his neglegance or dissorganisation in not checking the flat was suitable. I have not mentioned nearly half of the other problems including overflowing sinks due to poor plumming, our washing machine exploading due to it being faulty for a long time, or shower breaking and landlord taking 5 weeks to have it sorted which meant we had no hot water from shower for that time and this also meant the shower was on the whole time (i dont know why, when it broke, the button got stuck and wouldnt switch off) shower tech told us it wouldnt turn off until replaced. This cost us a fortune in water bills (which landlord did not compensate for). Plus a number of other problems involving provided electricals.  The biggest problem, even bigger than the mould was the bedbugs. The old horrible mattress that came with the flat was infested with bedbugs. They spread and attacked my daughter. She was covered head to toe in bedbug bites. Unfortunately dispite all our great efforts to wash and tumble dry everything and replace all furniture before moving into our new flat, we managed to take one with us to our NEW flat meaning we have had to pay \u00a3300 to have exterminators come over to try and resolve it. All because of poor disgusting conditions at previous flat. Now you know more of the story, you can perhaps imagine just how stressful this tenancy has been and how much we just wanted to get out of there frankly for the safety of our daughter. We could have been really bad and called council and enforced a lot of action but as we thought he was a nice guy we gave him the chance to do it himself.

It also states we would pay 50%of the mortgage payments\neach. He has never made a contribution to the mortgage. I asked my ex to move out after 6 months, due to his\ncontrolling and obsessive ways.

I then did not here from him until I contacted him via facebook\nto advise I wanted to sell the property.He has now contacted a solicitor and has requested 50% of\nthe equity and 50% of my initial deposit.

During that time we had two girls. they are now 7 and 5 and they live residentially with their mother approx 20 miles away. I am now in a new relationship with a lady (k) who also has two children who strangely are the same ages as my girls. :) it's not been easy as, until recently, I really struggled to bond with k's children due to not seeing and being with my girls everyday. but over time we've got there and things are now a lot better. its not k's or k's childrens fault so it would be unfair for them to suffer just because of my situation but it selfishly took me time to realise that. I really regret it now but i'm lucky enough to have the chance to do things right with k and her children;))))Anyway I came back from a military tour in Afghanistan to find that my wife had been growing to have feelings for another guy and although she denied anything physical was happening they were texting intimate and very sexual msgs within 24 hours and she was staying over his house after nights out so hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?I couldn't deal with that so I left her. now I must admit I went off the rails for a while and started drinking smoking etc as well as moving out of the family home. Things were awful for a long time and my prioritys selfishly weren't 100% on the girls but my head was really up my a~~e :((( In that few months fortunately the girls were too young to remember it and although I was there financially and physically I wasn't there mentally and I really regret that. however after I got myself straight I have been there 100% for the girls as best I could. I provide financially ( even when I was unemployed I paid the same amount as I was before)I have them at least every other weekend as well as half of every holiday period. I also travel to take them for tea 1 night every week. and I help contribute extra money towards school uniforms e.t.c and the girls are really happy around me and my new family and they know they are loved and cared for. :))))))since this situation (T) has always refused to travel and even used the term \" they're your children if you want to see them you will travel\" she knows I will do it because of my love for them so shes definitely in control of that one. unlike her I will not let the girls miss out on their parents because of our issues. the big bug bear at the moment is xmas. (T) has point blankley refused to let the girls wake up in my house on xmas morning??? she says I can have them from xmas morning through till boxing day morning every other year (again if I do all the travelling)!!And her reason for this \"theyre too young to wake up in somebody elses house other than their mums on xmas\" So new year is ok and half the holidays is ok and every other weekend is ok and any other time is ok but not that morning !!!!!! wtf!!!I have spoken to my soliciter and he says I could raise a court action but it could cost thousands. now I will pay this if I have too but I really don't want this to affect the girls and unfortunately they are too young to voice their concerns. now I'm fully aware of the girls in this and at no point will I put our squabbles before them but I feel that me,the girls and my new family are really missing out on a special time because of (T)s selfishness. The girls opinion will legaly count when they are twelve but the last thing I want to do is sit and ask them too choose because that would be awful for them so I would rather get this sorted and make it routine to do year about without their knowledge.Would i have a strong enough case to push for alternate xmas? and are the travel issues all on my back.?? obviously i will do it to see them but im intrigued where this stands legally?thanks folks :)))))))"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "21/06/14 10:39", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/court-claim", "1.Init_Post": "Hi,I have a doubt regarding money claim.

In December the neighbour behind us put in an application to build a two story extension on top of an existing converted single story garage (which would overlook us and another neighbour) but also to build a car port which would run the entire length of our only (little) garden right next to us. The car port would be larger than the entire ground floor of our house, 4 1/2 feet higher than our dividing fence and higher than our first floor extension and the wall less than 2 meters from our wall. This application was promptly withdrawn in January and we had peace until it was resubmitted in May with a tiny alteration to the width of the extension and nothing else. Anyway we called up the local council to ask how to object but we were met by a barrage of verbal abuse and accusations and questions about a path on our property (that we did not see as relevant) from the person working in the council who's final decision it is. At this point my family and I felt that no matter what our objections were the person who's decision it was was somehow biased. Regardless we put in strong objection letters as did our neighbour. 4 notified, 3 objecting. We also got in touch with a local councillor on the housing committee board who came to have a look and said they would help to fight our corner as the plans are ruinous to our home and garden and the car port could at least, be moved. 11 days after the date for objections closed on the council website it said the plans were given 'full permission' (bearing in mind it is normally 6 weeks before a meeting and usually all applications as far as I know, have a meeting). In the report the person in charge did not acknowledge any of our points of objection and said that everything was approved and following housing procedure, even though we started we would be hemmed in, overlooked, have constant noise etc. The persons boss also signed off on the approval. We telephoned their boss to leave a message but the council worker returned our call the following day. When we asked why there had not been a council meeting they said that they had spoken to a councillor on the board and they had said there was no need for a meeting and the plans should be recommended for approval, we confirmed the name of the councillor as the one we had been in contact with and she acknowledged that it was. After getting off the telephone to the council worker we called the councillor who said this was a complete lie, they had told her they wanted a committee meeting and wanted to attend and to raise points to amend the plans and to keep them informed in detail. Now that it has been approved we do not know what rights we have, even if it was approved by a biased worker. My family and I had the strong feeling from the beginning that the decision was corrupt, that the person making the decision was biased and it has been stated in the approval letter that she and the applicant have been in close constant contact since the application in December. We were certain that no matter what objections we raised the decision was going to be a favourable one as it already seemed approval had been promised to the applicant who began to prepare their garden before the closing date for objections. Do my family and neighbours and I have any rights if the council person has been biased, paid off, has made a decision based on partiality or vested interest? Is there any way to get the decision annulled due to bias of practice or something that does not involve paying for court as we do not have any money at all to do so?

My landlord is also the agency that arranged my viewing and the contract and they own my studio, other studios and a main house in the same address. They demanded a holding deposit of \u00a3400 before I signed the contract in order to take the property off the market and take my work references. If I gave up the property, I would lose this sum. When I saw the contract, its terms had some things that had not been discussed or that did not match what they had told me when I paid the money. For example, I suddenly had a \"no guests clause\" and I was expected to pay the council tax (contrary to what they had told me before). I was also tricked about the mould in the walls - which started to build up after some weeks of my tenancy. If I gave up the 400 \u00a3 I would be left with no money to find somewhere else in some months.Now, the problems with my tenancy: the landlord or construction workers sent by them are always around (daily), after work hours and at weekends. They have been inside my home without writen consent, as the landlord does not communicate with me in writing. I even had people trying to enter my home with a key during the day while the construction workers were at the site. Additionally, the landlord did not inform me about the protection of my deposit and, when confronted with this, he became hostile and insulted me. Now I suspect he is deliberately spying on me (because he has family living in the main house of the property) to know if I bring guests.My question is: without a break clause, is there a way I can leave without having to pay the 3 months of rent left in my contract? It is becoming impossible. It seems so unfair that landlords can evict tenants if tenants break clauses of the contract but not the opposite...

To that end, the section 71 offence will require an element of coercion or deception between the defendant and the victim.I am trying to ascertain the merits of arguing that this is a case that should be made in the Courts of Appeal as opposed to County Court so as to avoid ambiguity concerning what can be constituted as voluntary or not.

The letter told me that I was rated 'low' and therefore no longer quaified for assistance with funding.   It enclosed page 21, para 54 of the DH 113155 Guidance on Eligibility for Social Care. It also told me that I  shoud contact care agencies to arrange assistance with housework. It also said that it enclosed a copy of the 'recent assessment'.   This was, in fact, a wrong form.  I was given a typed up FACE report which is  different from the ASAQ assessment form. The letter did not inform me how to complain or challenge the decision. Had the Social Worker showed me the assessment form used, the Declaration page asked for a signature confirming the veracity of the answers and also that I have received 3 pamphlets, one of them describing the 'complaints, praise, comments procedure.'  I received none.  I did not even know how the form looked like and what questions it contained.  He merely read out some/all of the questions and maybe  all/some of the 4/5 available answers. He ticked the box denoting my answer, who knows? Almost 1 YEAR later I received a copy of the handwritten form, the ASAQ.  It was at this time I realised that it was unverified, unsigned and that I should have received the 3 pamphlets. In fact the form said at the bottom of the last page 'Thank you for completing this form.  It should be returned to your Care Manager or Occupational Therapist'. Had the Social worker followed the 113155, he could have left the form with me, to compete it at my own time, taking into consideration the 'bad', as well as 'good' days of my life and score the questions accordingly.  He did no such thing.  I was not made aware that I could in fact complete the ASAQ myself.   I had complained to the Council for not having been given the opportunity to complain.  They never referred to the fact that I should have received a pamphlet setting out this process.  Instead, I was given a number of conflicting excuses. The Disability Law Service adviser told me that the unsigned form is unsafe and should have never been used in a decision making process, where livelihood and wellbeing of an individual is decided on unsafe, unverified and unsigned information.

I did make a complaint about the unsigned ASAQ. Team Manager told me that it was not necessary to sign the form, as 'Social Worker was present'.  Indeed he was, because he conducted the assessment.  I just do not believe this statement.  You can see the letter at the below link. My original complaint was based on the FACE form, which was also incomplete, inaccurate  and unsigned. Because the Council could not provide answers to my complaint about non-adherence to the 113155, I complained to the Local Government Ombudsman, with the Council's knowledge.  The LGO did not ask for any explanation for non-adherence, but asked for copies of the assessment documentation.  He decided, that the Council's decision was valid.  I do not understand how the LGO could have decided in Council's favour, without seeing an independent assessment or interview me.   However, many of us know about the cozy relationship between the LGO and local authorities.  Many call the complaints a waster of time. When I brought to LGO's  attention that the form was unsigned, which emerged after the decisions, he refused to consider the fact, because I did not include it in my original complaint. Unfortunately, the Council in their reply to the LGO, sent not only what he asked for, ie the assessment documents (there was only one ever carried out, despite I was in Council's care since 2000), but also many pages containing  my personal medical information which is protected by Statutory Restrictions on data handling, specifically the NHS(venereal regulations)1974 and the subsequent NHS STD Directive 2000. In fact, the Council disclosed my health status for other purposes from those permitted by the Act. I think when the Council realised what had happened, they told me that they will no longer engage in correspondence of 'historic' value'. The assessment happened in October 2010. I did not find out until mid-2013 the existence of the Statutory Restrictions.  Although I had complained to the Information Commissioner in 2012 about breach of confidentiality by the Council for disclosing my details, which they should not have had in the first place, he told me that he cannot now consider a case which  was decided and closed more that 6 moths ago.  I have searched the web for legal advice on this particular matter, but could not find anyone, even with Law Society's help.

I used to teach a course in Comparative Law at the Sorbonne in Paris and, while not a lawyer, I have many years experience working in New York law firms.In the film, \"Minority Report,\" Tom Cruise's character arrested citizens simple on the basis that they were identified as going to commit a murder in the future. I would think, and hope, that many in the legal community wouldn't stand for such a law to come into effect today in the UK.Yet, I think there is a parallel today in the UK with the government's enactment in 2011 of a law declaring one guilty of a driving offence for parking your car off road and not having insurance. Yes, I know about the SORN process.While the reason this law was promulgated is laudable - the hope of reducing the number of uninsured cars ON THE ROAD - if one doesn't file a SORN then there is a DRIVING offence lodged against the registered vehicle keeper.The verb DRIVE implies operating the vehicle on public roads.\"DRIVING OFFENCE\", in my opinion, should imply being fined for actually DRIVING on a public road without insurance; a stationary car, parked off road, is not DRIVING on the road.This law of 2011 governing this issue should be reversed.For my occassional stays in the UK I keep a car at a friend's house. NotpreviouslyWhat I am seeking from Forum Members is advice on how to have the courts declare null and void this DVLA regulation/law on the basis that if a car is not being operated on a public road then the registered keeper can not logically be convicted of \"keeping a motor vehicle which does not meet insurance requirements,\" by recognizing that non-insured driving is a DRIVING offence and not a PARKING offence. I will represent myself pro se, but if someone wanted to go to bat with me to help reverse this oppresive piece of regulation, I'd be glad for the help.In conclusion: With the current Automatic Plate Number Recognition system, the country's police forces are more than adequately equiped to interdict DRIVERS in the act of driving without insurance. The SORN declaration is a useless piece of administrative paperwork that places an unwarrated burden on citizens in a country that already has more than enough red tape making daily life difficult.Thank you for taking the time to read this post!pARISpAT"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "06/03/14 19:56", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "  No one here can advise you how much you think you want for compensation - in my view you bear some responsibility for not securing the place yourself and then forwarding the bill to housing.

So contrary to one barrister's claim here, you won't get any notice from the courts.What happens is that when an energy provider like Npower decides that they want to enter your house to fit meters for what ever reason, they assign one of their debt collecting agencies to the job who will send you a notice about three weeks before using a second class post which looks pretty much like a flyer. So you better watch out for it because it can easily be mistaken as junk mail.They will ask you to contact the energy company. Not much point contacting the debt collectors who in my case told me that they had sent the file back to their client, they didn't know if there was going to be a hearing and they wouldn't even give you their email address unless you want to make a payment.In my case when I referred the matter back to Npower they told me that they already had a court order but it turned out that they meant they had applied for a court order.They may also tell you that you will get a notice from the court but you won't.

So believe who ever you want.Basically the debt collectors turn up on the day with a bunch of applications and hand it to the usher and unless the usher knows that there is some one in the court's building to defend it, the magistrate stamps them as approved.So if you want to defend it, as the court advised me you must turn up and MAKE SURE that the Usher knows that you have turned up, because they won't even check if you are there because unsurprisingly hardly anyone turns up for them.The only way to find out for sure that there may be a hearing to get entry into your house is to call the court 48 hours before and quote the debt collector's name (your own name won't be anywhere even then) who seem to book a hearing with the Magistrate like people make appointments with a dentist.You can make written submissions but it doesn't mean that the Usher will connect to the right application so it is best to turn up as the court's enquiry line advised me.She sounded pretty appalled by it herself and they don't usually make comments about cases. She said that I wished more people would turn up.But it is no wonder that people don't turn up. What if the debt collector hadn't sent me the letter or the letter had got lost in the post as a lot of them do? Would the bailiff believe that you had no knowledge of hearing?I have complained to the energy Ombudsman who say that the procedure has been checked with Ofgem and HMC services and it has been approved.I wrote to Ofgem who referred me to the Ombudsman.Something tells me that every one thinks that the Ombudsman has some sort of semi-judicial authority which they themselves clearly claim not to have. Even CAB seem to thinks that if I hadn't agreed to the Ombudsman's proposal then I won't have much of a chance in court which is pure madness because the Ombudsmen openly admit that they have no legal training.I criticized the situation in this forum and I got slagged off especially by a retired barrister who used to work with MOJ (Davidr). So I leave it to the readers to make their own judgement.One more thing I don't know how the bailiff part of it works but according to the debt collector's letter they will execute the warrant on the same day which I find unbelievable and even the court enquiry line didn't believe it but as you can see a lot of things to do with this particular \"due process\" seem unbelievable to a lot of people including I assume to Davidr.Good luck when they kick you door in, in the middle of the night as once Roger Waters sang in a song back in the eighties."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "22/02/14 03:16", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/contact-application-ffh-representing-myself", "1.Init_Post": "I'm a single parent to a 4yo disabled child with complex health and emotional needs.His father and I split when my son was one.

This feels like blackmail but I do need the money back as I've left myself vulnerable financially and in debt from helping him. He also wants his brother to come and collect his belongings, including a TV that my ex previously said I could sell to recover some of the money I'd lent him (under this provision that he will pay me back a set regular amount instead).He has defaulted on loans and owes thousands to sub prime lenders/log book loans etc. I really need some advice as to whether this is the best way to get a resolution without having to appear in court in front of him and some of my money back or if his solicitor will simply use my email to get the charges droppped then I'm unlikely to see any money from him anyway. This is his first offence so I'd also like to know what his sentence would likely be if it went to court. I read online it can be a prison sentence, fine or both but I'm guessing it wouldn't be much since he has no other charges? Neighbours gave a statement saying they saw him on a ladder trying to get in, heard me crying and shouting for him not to come in, the police found him in the garden and I provided a photo I'd taken on my mobile phone showing him trying to climb through an upstairs window. He has threatened to smash up my house and car and post private pictures online and I have no idea what to do for the best.

I met the boss1, I had an interview and he said that this is a normal job with contract, paying 1000 pounds per month, I agreed and started on 10th december.On 7th January I asked my boss1 on skype about the contract and the payment, he wrote \"I will make sure you will be payed for the month you already been here too\" (december).On 15 january I should be payed - I wasn't. On 17th January I went to my country for 10 days holidays (everything was agreed with my boss1). After I came back 28th January - my account was empty - I didn't receive any payment. For around 1.5 week I was asking my boss1 for the payment - he was saying that there are problems with accounting company, that I will be payed tomorrow, tomorrow etc. After those days, I wrote to another boss2, he said that he didn't know that I was working, he thought I was on internship; he also said that Boss1 is not allowed to make any offers, contracts and talking about the payments - \"he has no authority\" as boss2 said - he told me that on 6th February- so why I was hired by someone who has no authority?Now the whole conversation started again with boss2. He was saying to send him hours and days that I was working - he said he has to check this data with boss1 - it took him around 5 days. He also said that he will prepare my contract - he didn't.I started to look for help, I went to Citizens Advice Bureau, where I was told that I should write the\"Grievance Letter\" - I wrote it and I send it (11th February), in next 3 hours he send me the contract - wow :DAfter reading it I understood that if I sign it, then I will open a gate for my company to not paying me, and everything what was said ealier is not valid. In the contract he is saying that he will pay me for hours, which in total would be 1300 pounds for 2.5 months of my work: I did everything they asked me for. According to what bossA said I should get around 2000 pounds.All the conversations with Boss1 and Boss2 I have on skype and email.The contract says:1. \"This agreement supersedes any and all previous agreements made between you and the Company and will be superseded if detailed in writing and signed by you and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Company. Any other agreement of any kind is not valid and will not be honored by the Company.\"2. \"7.

The Company operates a flexi-time system and has core hours of work between 9:00am to 5:00pm. Due to the nature of the Company's business, however, flexibility in working hours will be essential as and when considered necessary to meet the business demands of the Company and its clients. Contract hours will be agreed and signed off on the week prior to working by either your line manager or the CEO.\"There is nothing about the hours which I worked in December and January. Also it says maximum of 37 hours...so after signing it they can say that I worked 1 hour in those 2 months....I wrote back to my boss2 email with all the changes and things that I didn't like about the contract - he wrote me this: \"Need you to sign our contract. However I will make an exception in the contract on maximum hours to accommodate what you have done.\"But I don't believe in this. Also I prepared a payment agreement for the hours which I worked in december and january and I asked him to sign it or tell me what he thinks about this agreement: but he didn't say anything to that.I am afraid of signing the contract because then he will make everything not valid.

RESPONSIBILITIES, not 'rights'. There is no such thing as 'custody' anymore, nor has there been since 1991, it is called 'residence'.  Your son and the mother of his child can have shared residence, either by agreement, or by your son making an application to the court.  It is preferable not to involve the courts, as whilst your son has PR, the mother of the child can make it incredibly difficult for him to see the child if she chooses and it can take years for a court order to be finalised if she keeps turning up in court, agreeing to contact, and then deciding against it.  Courts try not to allow this to happen, but the truth of the matter is that parents can be idiots when it comes to their children, especially very young parents, and they do not see that it is the child's best interests that should be served, not their own, and as a result lots of game playing takes place around contact. The decision really is your son's as to whether he thinks he can cope with shared residence of the child, if so, his first course of action is to speak to the mother and try to come to an agreement, and if that doesn't work, he can make an application to the court on form C100 for shared residence.

It's in their child's interests for them to be at least civil to each other - but being children themselves they may be too bogged down in their own emotions to realise this.  Discussing it all with a mediator may actually help them. The only way to get an informal agreement made 'official' is to go to court and have the agreement (which will be a consent order for contact) rubber stamped by the court.

At the moment he has access saturday through till Monday where his daughter stays with him for the duration, there are occassions where he will also have her during the week when the mother spends time at her new boyfriends house. Just recently there has been an argument between the mother and father which has now involved the grandmother, (mums mother) making threats to cause physical harm because she feels the father has said some upsetting things, (which I'm told he hasnt), I have also seen txt messages from the grandmother which are abusive and threatening, she actually came round the house while myself and my wife were at work to make the threats.I'm happy to put this to one side as I feel the childs welfare is of the utmost concern. I have called the grandmother on the mothers side to calm the situation, and really had to bite my tongue but during the conversation was told that my son will lose the right to see his daughter.

The mother ordered fish and chips at \u00a38.95 but the daughter, who only has a small appetite, said she felt overfaced at the thought of a full meal and wanted a smaller portion. The waitress informed them that they did not do a reduced-size portion, so the daughter said she would order a children's portion instead as she could eat that amount, but the waitress advised her that she would have to pay for the full adult price for it. Their policy is that no-one over 12 can order from the 'children's menu'.When I was told this story it made no sense to me as, after all no-one is getting something for nothing here: you are offering to pay the advertised price for a smaller portion (whether they dub that a 'child's' portion or not). I rang the restaurant manager who informed me that this was correct as \"otherwise we'd have a restaurant full of people eating from the children's menu\". I said to him effectively what they really wanted was everyone paying full price, irrespective of whether that size portion met their requirements, and leaving half the meal on the plate to go to waste as a result. He stated that there were other items on the menu to select from, but in a fish and chip restaurant it is not unreasonable to want fish and chips and there is no other reduced portion size of fish and chips listed on the menu.I can fully appreciate that someone aged 30 could not ask for a pensioner's 'special' as in this case they would be trying to obtain something for nothing (ie. a main course perhaps with a starter or dessert thrown in for the price that any other adult would pay); but this is clearly not the case in the instance of someone wanting a smaller portion at the advertised price for that smaller portion.He stated it was their policy that no-one over 12 could order from the children's menu.

The advantage of the latter method is that the court gets to hear both sides and any flaws in the application are pointed out to the court.Outside County Court LimitMy second ground for opposing the set aside order is that the claim was properly within the High Court and my claim for \u00a3100,000 (before interest) was above the county court limit when it was filed.Nature of claims are differentMy next objection is that the two claims are different and they originated differently: my claim in the High Court was commenced because the Defendant defaulted on a loan agreement for \u00a3100,000 dated 18/09/2010, while the Defendant's proceedings in Central London County Court were commenced by him on 15 November 2012, and were commenced because he wanted to sell his house and wanted my charging order taken off. He had applied for an account of what sums of money were owed by him under the loan.No abuse of processThe fact is that the judgment of 17th May 2013, was properly granted. The Defendant had filed his proceedings at Birmingham High Court on 15 November 2012, requesting my charging order be taken off and he be allowed to sell his house at 9c Kensington Court, London W8, and requesting an account be taken of what sums he was owing to me under the agreement.At the Hearing of 15 November 2012, I had asked the Defendant's lawyer for the Defendant's new address but he declined to provide it. I subsequently wrote a letter to his lawyers, James Pearce & Co \u2013 solicitors requesting his address but they failed to reply.The judgment of 17th May 2013, was not a default judgment as such: it was granted by Master McCloud after the Defendant failed to provide a defence for over a year and had failed to attend hearings during 2012. A brief chronology of matters is:7 Oct 2011, Dong Ping Wan files Claim in High Court; On 18 Oct 2011 Master Ayre makes an order that the court was to serve documents directly on the Defendant.1 Dec 2011, No defence filed so I apply for judgment; Defendant fax and post a letter asking Court to adjourns the hearing of 9 Jan 2012 claiming that he is abroad, letter received by the Court on 3 Jan 2012.He did not sound surprise that he know nothing about the claim, he failed to ask court for details of claim like his lawyer did on 17/10/2013 which is indeed know nothing. This is likely he know details of particulars of the claim.9 Jan 2012, Hearing before Master Eyre consider my application for default judgment. The Master makes an order to amend the claim and Defence.Second order before Master Rose on 11/7/2012.On 12 April 2013, I serve Amended Particulars of Claim on Defendant;17 May 2013, Hearing before Master McCloud, who grants judgment;The Defendant's suggestions that there has been an abuse of process are without foundation because neither the Defendant nor his lawyer had provided me with any new address so I was obliged to serve him at 9c Kensington Court, London W8, and in fact the Defendant only gave his new address to the court on 17th October 2013.I had regularly contacted both High Court and Central London County Court for the Defendant's address but until 17th October 2013, it was 9c Kensington Court. The only changed his address for service on 24th October 2013 at High Court. On 9.30am of 17 Oct 2013 I talked to the Central London County Court office manager about Defendant new address after he sold the old property under the Court injunctions. Court had great worry about this , a manager made notes on the court computer.Before the Hearing of 17th October 2013, in Central London County Court I had approached the Defendant and his lawyer and requested the Defendant's new address but they refused to supply it to me.In the circumstances I had asked the District Judge at the Hearing to be provided with the Defendant's new address and in his order of 24 October 2013, he had ordered the Court to update the Defendant's address to be 166 West Hall, Purley, London SW15 3SL.I was not at all obliged to serve the High Court documents on the solicitor which the Defendant was using in the County Court. It does not at all follow that if he was using a solicitor in the county court that he was instruct the same solicitor for any High Court Proceedings. There is no record in the High Court file for any lawyer.I had a large claim against the Defendant and I wanted to secure the debt by a charging order so I needed the Defendant's address but that was not given to me.I was perfectly entitled to, and the court rules permit me to, serve documents on the Defendant's last known address.In the circumstances I do not believe that any abuse of process has been made out by me.Prospects of SuccessI believe that my prospects of success with my claim are very good, after all the Defendant does not deny that he did approach me for the loan in question on 18th September 2010.Release of FundsFollowing the taking off of my charging order the Central London County Court ordered the Defendant to lodge \u00a3160,000 of the sale proceeds into court for me. I am now requesting that that sum of money (\u00a3160,000) currently being held in the Court Central Accounting Office be paid out to me.Statement of TruthI believe that the facts within this witness statement are true.SignedDate 26  November 2013."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "06/11/13 01:44", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "I suggest you ask this question in the Ask a Question Here section if the moderator does not move it there him/herself.", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "06/11/13 14:47"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "You should have post this question in \"Ask Question\" section", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "26/11/13 12:46"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "As far as I know  In case you want to avoid attending coroners Court due to anxiety attacks you first have to maintain a medical proof for the same, that may be helpful....!!", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "19/12/13 09:03"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "sophiadcruise - this is England.

(6+ years ago coincidentally!)SCI shares and ownership of property was never changed. No gift was ever made! On sale and dissolution of SCI, ownership was still legally recorded as 90/10 - giving more than enough cash and assets to pay my claim and costs (well near enough.)Civil PArtner has now disappeared with the cash and they are 'estranged' although he does have a PO Box in Kinghtsbridge!It is obviously all nonsense but IS appear to be taking the word (and that is all it is) of a PROVEN FRAUD who the original HHJ stated had lied under oath in the court case.The Bankrupt is clearly in breach of several rules and sections of the Insolvency Act but the IS don't seem bothered....Any ideas?

And so he wants he's money back\". The thing is, when he came to buy car he was checking it all over (over 1 hours or so) and he had long test drive. I pointed that the car has got some scratches, that the button of one window (front passanger side) sometimes plays up but you can open it by other buttons. On the dashboard there is a sing of breaks which apear before and I took to mechanic and he said to don't worry about it because it is just a sensor which costs \u00a310, but breaks work perfecly. He tested the breaks, and also he tested them during test drive and he said \" They are ok\". There was some noise which he said that he hear in front left wheel, which I and my brother didn't hear. He gave the name of it, and he offered to reduce the price for \u00a3200 which we agreed. I want to say here that I had this car for nearly 5 years, and I never had problem with it! It was driving perfectly, engine was working smooth and it was well maintain. I change all for tires last year. I gave him a history of last 3 or 4 MOT's. On last MOT the car just went in and went out. They didn't find any problems, and any of those which he was telling about !! Now, afer a week that guy calling me and he is aggressive, abusive and swering to me that he wants his money back. I called Citizen Advice, and they said to me: to don't give him any money because this car it is his property now. And we don't know what he was doing with it, if car is involved in robbery, or he change the parts. He bought it as it is, beware.

Had any of you went throught someting like this ? If yes, How did it finish? Please help.I forgot to add, I'm not a mechanic so how would I know if anything is wrong (unroadworthy, if it drives and also breaks prefectly) ? And how I would check that after a week he did'nt damage the car, or changed the parts ? And also was treating this car like my baby, and I truly have a clean soul.

I rechecked your original post and noticed you used the phrase \"owning\" a vehicle without insurance. (There is no such offence).  Quite often on this forum people not familiar with the law use terms which they understand but do not bear the same legal meaning. Those of us who answer have to sometimes make an educated guess at what they mean. I assumed by owned that you meant \"used the vehicle without insurance\" which is an endorseable offence. Following your latest post I now think it more probable that you have been convicted of \"keeping\" a vehicle without insurance. This involves a situation where the DVLA records show that a vehicle is not insured and they have not received a SORN notice. Do you still have the vehicle? This is not endorseable and may explain the lack of contact from DVLA. However the rest of the advice given still applies about the stat dec. I have to say I am shocked and utterly appalled because the policy apparenty being operated by the court which you describe is completely unlawful. In effect the court administrators are preventing you from using a right which an Act of Parliament gives you. By doing so they are putting you at risk of being being penalised by bailiff action.   I suggest as an alternative you visit a solicitor ( you could simply go to the court and ask one of the solicitors present) and get him to witness your Stat dec (fee will be about \u00a38) and take it to the court and hand it in ( make sure you get a receipt and keep a copy). This will mean that the conviction will be immediately void as will any warrant so the bailiffs cannot act. This method is just as valid and effective and the only reason I  first suggested making the stat dec in front of the court is because it is free! The court will not be interested at this stage at the merits of the case. As DVLA often falls behind with its record keeping it is quite frequently taking case to court without cause. Once the stat dec is made you can then deal with the facts of the case. The chances are they will not restart proceedings. Hope this helps.

As the law relating to Stat Decs has been with us since 1835 it seems unlikely to change now. I am pleased you stood your ground - imagine if you had not. The bailiffs could have called at any time and do you really think they would believe your efforts to make a stat dec? Personally I would still make a complaint because although they have given you assurances the fact is the people who made them do not have the legal authority to do so. Under S14 (3) Magistrates Courts Act 1980 only a magistrate can accept a statutory declaration made after the 21 day period.

In normal spaces it can be difficult for able bodied people to squeeze in and out but for someone with restricted mobility it can prove impossible, often they have no choice but to wait for an appropriate space to become available.  I think the mother and baby spaces are less of an issue but its a struggle placing a baby in a car seat or to strap toddlers in when the door access is restricted so it is common courtisy to leave these wider designated spaces for them - thats what they are for.

I filed that claim because I found that the Claimant had not repaid me anything as was agreed.I had of course served those proceedings on the present claimant, Nicholas Montague Smyth, by fax but he had failed to put in any defence.Following service of the High Court claim the claimant had failed to attend one hearing after another and the court eventually decided that to ensure he was properly served that it would serve notices and documents on him directly.Despite serving the documents on the Claimant directly the court noticed that he continued to fail to attend hearings and therefore on 17 May 2013, Master McCloud authorised a default judgment be entered.In the circumstances the reason why there has been some duplication in proceedings is because the Claimant in these proceedings filed his claim in 2012 when he wanted my charging order taken off his property so that he could sell it and he had filed his claim when there were already proceedings taking place between the parties.Yours faithfully"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "13/11/13 03:03", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/early-pension-release", "1.Init_Post": "Early Pension Release.

I have tried to be as specific as possible. The bathing water to our 4 flats has in the past been provided from a communal tank in the attic space of the block. Our leases clearly give us right of usage but no right of access and clearly defines the servicing of the supply to be the responsibility of the management company that was set up by the previous land lord to service the common parts, and not the landlords responsibility. In the past , although the tanks were in the attic which was the landlords demise, access was through an un locked trap door and servicing, including the installation of new feeds and returns to the tanks for two of the flats has been provided by the management company. The landlord has now built a new penthouse flat and access to the tank area is now situated behind the locked front door to the new flat, which is now being offered for sale on a long leaae. Irrespective of what demise the tanks are now in and what clauses are put into the lease of the penthouse flat, my question is I think relatively straight forward......in the past my lease has provided that any issues regarding servicing of the supply of bathing water to flats was an issue that was resovable between the leaseholder, the mangement company and the landlord..........Does not the insertion of a forth party into this equation infringe the terms of my lease?.

She also had a number of items namely a beatles collection which she kept as a momento and always said she would not sell the items.After finding out, from my niece where the funeral was taking place, as she had not notified me or my mams sister, we all gathered and tried to be a family. My thoughts were that it might have brought us together but later at the wake she started a fight saying ' where was I when she wanted to go on holiday ' which was disgusting and I done the right thing and walked away knowing she had done this just to get a reaction from me.I had no contact with her for a while, while everything was going on, as I was till grieving and seething about my sisters conduct on that day. I live 35 miles away and at the time the car I owned had to be push started.Mid February I got a phonecall from my aunt who said Julie had been up to her house and dropped some photos of for me so I took it upon myself to check whether the house was up for sale, as I knew something was not right. To my amazement the house was, and the photos on the website of Andrew Mclean showed the house to be gutted, apart from a television and a couch and my mams double bed. I sent texts to my sister trying to divulge if she had done this intentionally and I didn't say I knew the house was up for sale at first to try and see if she would admit to taking the items out the house. ( please see transcript from my iphone 09.02.2013 ). She has shockingly said that my wife and I were not allowed in the house as my mam had stated this. Which is Definitely not the case and I have confirmed this from my aunt who was one of the last to see her.I know 100% that she has taken items from the house, ( \u00a3300 in an envelope for my sons birthday ), as my aunt has confirmed this to me and she is doing her best todeceive me. I hoped the solicitors would have helped me through this and would have been able to quash any fears I may have but this hasn't happened as we use the same solicitor ( a solicitor my sister chose, but I agreed at the time ). I have had no choice of items or anything that relates to executor duties or probate duties.I have offered her numerous times money to buy her share of the property, \u00a330,000 on the 9th Feb and have offered that a few times. She has offered me \u00a325,000 which is an insult. The house had an offer of \u00a365,000 but was refused by my sister and estate agent.Is this right?? The solicitor says it takes just one executor to deal with the items. So what is the point of all this?. I have no power and its infuriating and I cant grieve till its sorted.Hope you can help.Tom"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "19/08/13 20:04", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "It doesn't matter what you believe.

I do accept I will have to deal with what happened to my dad at some stage but I don't agree entirely with it been a way of expressing my feelings through this girl. By that I mean this happened with my dad a year ago, I have had plenty in between where I could have expressed these feelings through other events. It does sound awful but I think the general attraction to her is making me care a lot more because she was not the only victim in this case and I haven't considered the others in the same way. (Although she was classed as the prosecutions main witness so we got a much deeper insight into her life). I understand my family have had a hard time but what this girl went through is a million times worse. I had my dad for 23 years, she's the same age and had none of the opportunities and things like school friends etc that I took for granted. We effectively compared our upbringing during our conversation and hers was heartbreaking, If she simply got beaten she saw that as a good day in that at least she had not been raped on that occasion. To hear that in court and then meet the person to see how courageous she is, you would have to have a heart of stone to not form some emotional attatchment. I aren't exaggerating in the slightest when I speak of the progress I have made and messing everything up terrifies me but I can't leave it alone. I haven't contacted her yet and don't think I will but its difficult to ignore genuine emotion. I do desperately want to become a lawyer and continue my progression but I feel as if I could bring something good to her life and help her make up for lost time In some form. I do also think it needs remembering that she is the victim, not the defendant and I would also like to state this isn't a sexually motivated thing either, I just want to bring some happiness into a persons life who has had very little. When I say contact her I mean perhaps go for lunch, shopping, just everyday things. I certainly don't want to sit and discuss what her father did to her unless she wanted to talk about it, I feel I could be there as a friend to listen. I have changed and grown up an awful lot in the last twelve months and realise that around judges, barristers etc you have to be much more aware of any impressions you give out. I suppose I am asking effectively if anything was to happen and considering she's a witness on a trial that's finished (they were found guilty of the rapes)  what negative effect could this now have on my career?

It isn't about what 'could affect' any prospective career - it's simply that it is entirely inappropriate and you are failing to see that, which is showing elements of poor judgement: lousy trait for a lawyer.

I particularly agree with what you say about having these problems on every single case I am involved in as i'd never get any work done.

I was in a boring job and very much stuck in a routine in my area and with the people I mixed with. I was happy but life was a bit boring. I went onto do an access course more to impress my parents but I became totally engrossed in the course and quickly moved onto a law degree. Upon starting university I made a decision to cut all contact with old friends and moved location in my part time job to fully change my life. I started uni and my life completely changed, I made new friends and loved every minute of the first year, a week before I started my father took his own liand in horrific circumstances and uni was so great i actually barely thought about what had happened.

Anyway to get to the point i have made amazing progress and sit at the crown court alongside the judge whenever he enables me to and I seem to get success with every company I ask for work placements etc, my life is all coming together until an incident the other day. I sat on an extremely long and horrific rape trial involving a family. During my lunch the prosecution witness approached me and we talked for around an hour. I had seen her give evidence and was completely fascinated with her when she came over and the conversation was one of the most emotional I have ever had. The prosecution barrister approached me and said It was not a good idea to be seen talking to her and although I felt a bit naive the court were fine with it and we never spoke of the subject again, it was effectively lesson learnt. The case is family rape and without wanting to give full detail its as horrific as it could be. My problem is I am desperate to contact this girl. The rape trial concluded and the only outstanding matter is her mothers trial for intimidating a witness which happens to be the girl I am talking about.

Many people worry about the fine or other penalty. Actually, receiving a red light camera ticket does not always mean that you will have to pay a fine, especially if you do not think that the ticket is fair. For example, if the photo is not of you, or if it is too blurry to be sure, you can typically avoid paying the fine. In addition, if the warning sign for the camera on the LED traffic light is not easy to see, you may be able to fight the ticket since the sign is supposed to be visible to all traffic. Finally, if you suspect that the yellow light is unusually short, your ticket may be thrown out, since this may result in insufficient time to stop before the red light appears. In most cases, it is advised that you talk to a lawyer to find out if you have a strong case.Warning signs for the camera on the LED arrow light are usually required to be seen from cars traveling in any direction, even if the camera only takes photos of cars going one way. This typically means that there should be four signs around the LED traffic signal at the affected intersection, so if the area in question is missing even one sign, providing proof via a picture can help you fight the red light camera ticket. If the signs are all there, but some are either vandalized or difficult to see because of foliage, you may still have a case. They need to be made obvious to drivers, so if you find them difficult to spot while driving, you have a chance of getting the ticket dismissed.A yellow LED arrow light that is shorter than usual can result in more red light camera tickets. If you can provide evidence that the yellow light does not appear long enough before turning red, you may be able to have your red light camera ticket dismissed. Most areas have a minimum length that the yellow light must meet, so consider videotaping the light in order to show the court that there may be an issue with it. Anyway, as long as you can be careful and watchful while driving on the road, especially passing LED arrow light with a camera, you can avoid the trouble.

Many, many people, whether in care or not, fail to succeed at school, only to later, once they are mature and more able to see the benefits of an education, return to such and make a success of it second time around. The fact that they can do that at that time, does not mean that they could have done it first time around, so proving that the treatment they received back then was responsible for their lack of achievement initially would be virtually impossible. My suggestion would be to undertake some counselling (if you haven't already), to assist you in dealing with your background and then focus on the fact that you have managed to get a good job, have a partner and children and focus on the positives.  Too many people keep looking to the past, instead of to the present and to the future, and as a result miss out on the very good things that are happening for them currently.

Apologies if I miss any forum etiquette.My question relates to Social Services care.I am 38(yesterday) andI spent my childhoodunder the care of social services (from birth andsupposedly a short term solution to adulthood).I wasregularly visited by birthparents until I was about 9 years old (contact was stopped by them). At no point was adoption considered as an option. My birth mother was a difficult person with her own set of problems and my Father a 'flighty dreamer' sort.My chidlhood wasnot as devastatinglybad as some suffer, butwas traumatic.I was rather withdrawn, down to what I think a consequence of my situation. At one point I attempted suicide(there is no record of this)At the start ofSchool social and educational services had attempted to put me into a School for SpecialEducational needs. In fact I have it on record as the head of a department of social services calling me 'cold and calculating'. (I was 3 years old at the time).Due to the diligence and fight of my Care mother I stayed in mainstream school, under the premise of alwaysbeing in the bottom class. I was held back a year despite attaining 'best improver awards' and 'top marks ' awards in my the bottom set class.Subsequently after school(mid 20s) I returned to education andwith a level playing field achieved high grade GCSE, followed by high gradeA-Level through to degree and now have a reasonable job in Engineering.I have always felt the care system held me back, and between the school and social services I wasn't allowed to reach any kind of potential. With these services being a symptom.Against Social Services, I feel I was so quiet , not a serious case and comparably easy to manage they left me in the situation I was in, I feel they should have confronted my Parents postion earlier and addressed whether i should be with them or remain in care permanently.The school subsequentlylooked upon a child in care and seemingly used this to maintain me in the bottom class. At no point in Junior education was this reviewed.During the whole care scenario at no point was anything expected of me than to go to a low skilled job, or; as many children who go through the care system, end up in Prison.Would I have a case for professional negligence?"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "05/06/13 02:03", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/solicitor-addressed-me-shit-brains-0", "1.Init_Post": " "}, {"2.Time_Posted": "04/06/13 06:52", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/company-law-2006", "1.Init_Post": "Is there anyone who can tell me a couple of things about the above legislation?"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "03/06/13 22:25", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/nuisance-neighbour", "1.Init_Post": "can a someone help please my neighbour who is a tenant to a private landlord in the last 3 weeks has stabbed the shop assistant in the shop across the road committed arson on her property and is banging on walls and throwing furniture around her house.

I have had quotes re a consultation re a case where a number of chambers have told me that it would cost between 2-3 thousand pounds for a hour or so chatAlso that there was no guarantee that they would take the case but would keep the fee.This is all very well for a wealthy individual where money may be no object. However the sitaution is completely different for someone whose entire career, company livelihood, family standards etc come into play. They have not the training, money or the time to be about same and as a result suffer.There is apparently a term in the legal business that says that somebody who represents themselves in court have a fool for a client. This is not so. Necessity makes it a case for doing so. There are more and more people representing themselves in court and also the High court out of necessity on a daily basis , because if they did not they would not have the the ability to exercise their right to be heard and give their side of their story.This site comes to the fore and hopefully the rescue by giving Pertinent and Correct information to people who post questions on same as they need good information which will/would make it easier to take on a court case by themselves. Foreknowledge is a great way to prepare for a case and relevant information makes it so.Also people who ask questions on this site have other things to do as wel than to read quantities of knowledge to get the relevant information. Again relevant information applies here to the problem stated. Litigation in person is more than ever a necessity considering the costs of a case. Many people cannot afford legal fees and by due dilligence and intelligent procedure take on the case themselves, to be their own fool by dire necessity.I would appreciate it if legal people of all persuasions and all areas of law bear this in mind when sites like this are used by members of the public. It takes courage to be a litigant in person and the more Relevant and Pertinent information given in answers is of great importance and necessity towards a satisfactory conclusion for the litigant in person. Pertinent knowledge is not only power but alsoa catylist to success.You must also remember that the legal system in this country goes back many centuries where the wealthy and only them had the opportunity to go to court. There is nothing foolish in having your right and exercising it in a court room by doing so yourself by dire necessity due to lack of funds; funds which are decided and controlled by the very legal system which purports to defend a person's right to speak.Freedom of speech is available.

Every week from this time (10 months of age-13months of age) I travelled 100 miles to bond with him, I hired a car every time as I do not own one.

As we have an excellent OSP scheme in place, we had paid him \u00a32117.04 of days where we was absent. This was removed with immediate effect and any further absences would attract the SSP rate only. We decided that a final written warning was appropriate, given the circumstances.He appealed this decision and it was upheld by our COO who highlighted that the persistent short term absence levels were unacceptable and this needed to change.OK - so, we have timesheets for each employee of what time they arrive to work.

The absence notification procedure (where lateness is covered within this procedure but that is what its called) states that informing your line manager via email or text message ONLY is not sufficient. He did this on two of the occasions mentioned. Within this period, he has had two informal discussions with his line manager highlighting him that he is continuing to be late to work, as well as not following the procedure.Am I right in saying because yet again he is not following procedure, we can invite him back to a hearing and have grounds for dismissal?

However every product listed on the website is clearly identified as fake, and the consumers are fully aware of it.I started the business when I was at university and didn't think twice about legal issues that this may consequently have on me, but now that the business is becoming popular and the turner is considerably higher, I have started to think that I could be legally responsible. IThe thing is, I don't actually have carry any stock or even package up any stock, as it all stock is outsourced through a website called , ioffer.com. Ioffer is a bit like eBay, where people around the world can sell products, mainly sellers from china. This is where I buy all the stock for the website from. However I do not buy in bulk like you would expect, instead I buy the products from ioffer when a consumer buys the products from my website.This is how it work - A customer would order a product from my website, then someone from my business would then place an order on ioffer.com for the same product which is displayed on my website. Then we would just add the customers address to deliver the product at their house. We are only the middle people. I don't dispatch the products, nor do I ever come into contact with the sellers.The items are mainly dispatched from China, and are usually are bought by customers in the UK and US. They go through customs, but I've never had any problems.I know that it is illegal as it infringes the feudal trademark law, but I'm not actually the one handling the goods, I'm just the middle man.I have stated on the website in the terms and conditions that we dispatch all gods from San Marino where it is not illegal to sell fake goods, that way I thought I could not be held responsible. I also warn people in the terms and conditions that it is illegal to buy anything from this website if you live in a country where the feudal trademark law applies, which are most MEDC countries. It also says that \" we do not have the faculty to check if a given address is within a country where the trademark law applies, therefore it is your responsibility to check this\". Customers sign to these terms and conditions when signing up.On ioffer most of the sellers lie and say that the real genuine product within the description, when they are obviously not. I thought that maybe that would make them responsible, as they are saying it's the real product, then dispatching it off to countries where buying fake designer products is illegal. So surely they are the one doing the crime? I however are honest and say on my website that the products are fake, but use ioffer as the source of the product.What I would like to know about this issue.-As I'm not handling the products, am I still breaking the law?- I have given you a brief description of what is stated in my terms and condition, is that sufficient to make me not illegally responsible? If not, what type of things should I put? (Do you know how write a disclaimer for my situation, which makes me not legally responsible for selling fake designer products?)- If they did trace the sale down to me, what legal consequences could I face?"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "05/04/13 20:34", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "can anyone shed any light on this please   ", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "06/04/13 00:05"}], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/updating-will-due-being-remarried-0", "1.Init_Post": "Im a 50 year old female. married - divorced and recently remarried. i have 2 grown up children and 2 grandchildren.during my divorce period i bought myself a house this was in my 1st marriage name, [the same surname as my children]. this house still has a small mortgage.

In short, I've received a large number (44) of harrassing emails, of which 3 or 4 were defamatory in respect of making serious (and unsubstantiated) accusations of theft against me. The scenario is that this individual arranged to purchase some bicycle wheels from me (direct) from private individual to private individual and he bacs'd the money to my personal bank account. I sent the wheels by recorded delivery RM post and these appear to have failed to arrive according to the RM website, but I have fulfilled my part of the deal by sending them.

I was in the process of trying to trace them and then submit a claim against Royal Mail for their loss when I began to receive the defamatory emails from the buyer - all of the email comms were sent through his employer issued email address at a major telecom. As they have failed to arrive safely with him, he is now threatening me with a small claim action on the basis that I am responsible for their safe arrival under the \"Distance Selling regulations\" and the \"Trade Descriptions Act\" despite me being a private individual and not a company or trader. I have offered him the option to fully retract his defamatory accusations and provide an undertaking of no court action, upon receipt of which I will submit the claim to RM to recover as much of the loss as possible, otherwise I will make a formal complaint to the executive board of the telecoms company about his conduct and defamatory statements and make a claim for damages against them bcause of his conduct. I was hoping that he would not wish for his employer to be dragged into this with the inevitable difficulties that this may well cause him. I could well do without the time, effort and aggreavtion required to defend any action and would be extremely grateful if anyone reading this could let me know their thoughts on the position of either/both parties in this dispute, and a good strategy to succeed?

In September last year, I decided to open my own barber shop and was looking round for a suitable place. I found one and it is above a sandwich shop. It is an open plan area with a small kitchen and toilet, and another room that the landlord was using as an office. He offered me the room at an extra cost which I wanted as I wanted to have a beauty room with sunbeds, this was always my plan but I said I would take it on at the end of the month, when I had set myself up first, and he agreed. Towards the end of that month I sent him a message saying I wanted the room. He replied that was fine, and he would add the extra money on the monthly rent. I told him I had someone interested in working in the room in October and he replied that he would need about 4-6 week to find a place so I said that was fine. At the end of November, I said the person wanted to move in but he then said he wanted ONE years rent up front for the room. I told him that was not possible as I did not have the money. He then said he did not want to move out of the office but would as he had said I could have it, (I would not have rented this place if I could not have the room as it was part of my plan). He has made no effort since then to move and it has come to a dead end, and I lost the person one wanted to work there! Now, part of the contract stated that the landlord must give the tennent 24hours notice before coming into the shop and that obviously does not happen. It as gone form the part time secretary who worked tues, wed & thurs 10-2 to the land lord been there everyday, his builders (as he owns a building company) up and down the stairs, and other people coming in for meetings daily.

If subsequently the the interest on whatever is being borrowed had been manipulated and that interest then applied to the guarantor, then it is certain that the Guarantor could not have known this at the time that they entered the initial arrangement. The Guarantor will have acted in good faith, but could it be said that the bank had done the same, as there were clearly material facts omitted from the Guarantor's decision making process in which I believe an unconscionable agreement could be argued? If a bank leads one to believe that they act honestly, and it is subsequently discovered that they have not, then they have misrepresented themselves to any customer.  Whatever way you look at it the Libor fraud will have very far reaching implications for the banks involved.", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "11/02/13 09:06"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "I agree we need someone to take this case on.

The FSA is now looking very carefully at the banks but it could take time to fully investigate and put right all is wrong. To the best of my knowledge there are no Law firms in the UK who would take it upon themselves to represent on masse those members of the public who are victims of unscrupulous bank practices. Again to the best of my knowledge there are few people with the type of funding that will allow private prosecutions, so maybe the way forward is to hand individual cases to the media with a view to them having a field day. Where a bank has contravened an individual's human rights there is always the option to seek a judgement in Strasbourg. Like you I feel that something has to be done - quickly. NB.

If you had known that this sort of thing was going on, is it likely that have this would have caused you not to be a party to the guarantee, or maybe not have had anything to do with the banks involved in the first place?This raises very interesting questions, for example is the bank that is holding your guarantee now foreclosing on it and taking you to court, and also are those guarantees taken during that timescale but not being foreclosed upon still valid in view of the criminal activities of the banks involved. And does this mean that all existing personal guarantees taken between 2006 and 2011 have to rewritten?It is a fact that in thousands of cases largely due to the financial crisis that they have created, the banks have cancelled the overdrafts of hundreds of companies, and then gone on to pursue the personal guarantors. In other cases companies have folded without the help of the banks due to adverse trading conditions, but the end product is the same - the banks want their money back by hook or by crook. This all seems to be very one-sided and unfair. Fairness is a principle of English Law, and when the boot is on the other foot it is only too common for institutional organisations to invalidate agreements and contacts because of none-disclosure. To site a few common examples, would you expect to be able to make a successful claim on an Insurance company where you had given false or misleading infomation, or in another case is it likely that a bank would freeze a bank account, where it was discovered that the holder of that account had been involved for example in criminal activities such as money laundering?I suspect that the whole thing revolves around the question of the non-disclosure of what are considered to be important facts that would materially alter the position of those who are involved in the transactions, had they known about them.I suspect that the Court of Human Rights would rule in favour of the victims of the banks, but in reality this needs thoroughly testing through the UK courts.If you were to try and pursue this through the courts at your own expense I suspect that the lack of knowledge and the cost would be immediate hurdles, so what is needed is a competent firm of lawyers who would take it on themselves to push this right the way through the UK courts, and then if necessary to the European Court of Justice and maybe to Strasbourg.Does such a firm or lawyers exist, or are they all so interested in their own affairs to bother?Well that is the question - but it does need testing."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "06/02/13 19:05", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "Hello, Friends Let me introduce myself I am magonSteven a new member  for this community.

I sent in photos of the vehicle externally internally which according to their standards matched what was required . Some six weeks later and i received a refusal letter on the grounds that the vehicle although meeting the standard did not look enough like a motorcaravan from the outside and that it hadnt changed other than the addition of windows since it was originally constructed by the maker (ford iveco cargo ) .I phoned the number on the letter and was also told the vehicle was too heavy ? Obviously at 5tons unladen that is not the case as there are a great many motorhomes that far exceed this weight . I asked why the weight issue was not included in the letter they didnt know . I asked what if it was too heavy was the maximum limit allowed they didnt know that either . I said the vehicle was very much changed from its orignal spec it now had a chimney protruding from the roof , staired access an access door a 3ft outside strip light a barbecue hook up point , a toilet access panel , battery access panel and two huge water tanks and filling point .I wrote a letter of complaint and some 7 weeks later received an equally bizzare reply telling me my vehicle has an incorrect MOT and that any vehicle over 3501kgs is liable for a goods vehicle test and that i am legally required to fill out a vtg10 form and inform vosa . My vehicle despite its size comes under a class 4 MOT as vosa state that any vehicle with windows and living quarters and not capable of carrying goods commercially is to be MOTd under class 4 regardless of the usual 3500kgs WEIGHT limit normally applied this is well known in law . Vosa after a call said the DVLA were wrong my vehicle didnt need a VTG10 form as it was obviously not a vehicle used to carry goods anymore they said the vehicle was correctly Motd under class 4 regulations and that they would not MOT the vehicle as a goods vehicle as it wasnt . My current Mot has the words Motorhome on it so clearly VOSA recognise my vehicle as a Motorhome which i would guess would cover Motorcaravan . Therefore one might question why the DVLA dont recognise the vehicle as such right?All i have tried to do is correctly apply the body type on my V5logbook so that the DVLA and other enforcement agencies can easily identify the vehicle . However as said the DVLA has refused stating that the vehicle does not look enough like a motorcaravan in their view and thus have changed body type to \"van with windows \"Clearly my vehicle is a Motorcaravan or motorhome clearly Vosa recognise my vehicle as such hence the MOT class 4 . Clearly the DVLA are being obstructive without valid reason .I am trying to sell my vehicle not having the correct bodytype on the V5 severly reduces my ability to sell the vehicle and obviously detracts from the value .

Article 1 of the Convention requires a member country to provide a remedy, Article 13, for breaches of Convention rights. If it does not, under Neves e Silva v Portugal, a ECtHR precedent, if you have an arguable case of violation of a Convention right, you have a right to be heard in a domestic court. If there is no domestic remedy, the violation is ongoing, without a time limit. The ECtHR have held that for a remedy there has to be the provision of information to friends and relations as without it there can be no investigation [Abdullatif Ilhrens v Turkey.]and  without that there can be no remedy. Article 8 is not an absolute right, but seems to cover anything in your private life. Any breach of domestic law is automatically a violation of Article 8. Mitigation does not come into the picture with Convention rights. The reticence about her 'phone should be immaterial. However, the thin skull rule does if someone suffers more than another might because of an underlying vulnerability. You have described someone whose whole sense of self-worth has been taken away from herself. There is a requirement for the government to ensure that its people have the best health that they can in an earlier international law, which has escaped my memory. I am not a lawyer. I can only point you in a direction that may or may not be helpful, and I do not want to get your hopes up that there being an international law to protect individuals from the power of the state means that you can achieve what you need to. Dinah Shelton, an American law academic wrote that the hurt done by the state is infinitley greater for being inflicted by the authority we expect to protect us. The Law Commision's report, 266, part IV is about damages under the Human Rights Act (report) [2000]EWLC 266 (4) (October2000) The police lost some immunity under Osman v UK. An immmunity makes a nonsense that all are equal under the law, it puts some above the law, beyond accountability. The HRA, 1998, has a very short time limit in which to take action; one year. However, if an actionable harm has ocurred due to an unlawful action of a state body, by unlawfully violating a Convention right, I believe I read that one can take an action in tort for negligence which gives you 6 years, but  do check on this. There may be a shorter time limit for your particular case. You should need to establish the conditions from which your relation suffers were caused by her demeaning and humiliating treatment.   Perhaps a start is to require the police to provide information. The ECtHR has held public bodies have to disclose information only they hold as to not do so is to deny access to court, Article 6, right to a fair trial. There is a Human Rights blog written by Rosalind English, and David Hart, both barristers specialising in such,  of 1 Crown Row. You might find something in the archives.

It is hardly the guarantors fault if the landlord is remiss or just plain lazy in his duties.

We do not get any response.The facts areWe own a Kia Rio, which we bought to take our grandson on regular sunday days out. We paid approximately \u00a3600 for the car and we had no problems with it.We have recently made an insurance claim for repairs to our damaged car after a side impact collision forcing the car wheels to make contact and be be jammed into the curb. The result of the collision was a dent in the front drivers side door, and more worryingly a grinding and scrapeing noise from the car. The car was not driving correctly after the incident. The steering was heavy and it felt unsafe.We reported cosmetic and mechanical damages to our insurance. Though DRIVE ASSIST were happy to deal with the cosmetic damages (which we really dont care about), they have refused to deal with the mechanical damages (which we do care about). We have repeatedly mentioned to them that we are not concerned with the look of the car but require some sort of assurance that the car is safe to drive and that we expect the mechanics of the car to be thoroughly checked for possible damage and safety issues. They have again refused to do this stating that any damage that has occured has happened due to fatigue. As an experienced and chartered mechanical engineer and highly qualified metallurgist, I cannot understand how any could make such a claim without the correct knowledge and application of non-destructive testing.The mechanic who tested the alignment of the car stated to us that there is damage to the front and rear axle. This is generally caused with the mounting of a curb.I have contacted a local garage and fracture analysts and materials engineers at Swansea university who have given me a short report of damage which may be caused by a side impact collison where the wheels have mounted a curb or struck an imovable object below the shaft centre of radius. They have also mentioned that they can analyse a component and by the deformation of the materials grains and dislocation of its atomic planes, accurately assess whether the damage has been caused by fatigue, creep or impact forces. The contents of the report (please see attached) have been sent to DRIVE ASSIST after they required us to be more specific about the damage to the car. They still refuse to make the correct checks and fail to offer us written confirmation that the car has been checked and tested and is SAFE.If drive assist are so certain that the car is without fault caused by impact, then why wont somebody sign to state as much. It is of my way of thinking that Drive assist have no consideration of our safety but have chosen to make a quick buck from our misfortune.Finally, though we stated that we didnt require a replacement vehicle we were talked into taking one. We have had this car for over a month and the costs that this has incurred to the liable insurers (Hastings) must be be more value than the Kia Rio.

At two points during the duration of the practice we had a complaint, once off a women living about 2 doors away, complaining that we were two loud, and once again off the same woman, saying that \"we have been playing all day, and we all dont want to hear it\".A neighbor of the house we were practicing at said, that we wern't too bad (noise wise) just that the drums were a bit noisy and just ignore the first complaint there just being picky, and that we sounded good.We don't practice often at our drummers home, nor at regular intervals, as we have practice rooms at our local school which we accomidate in our own hours. At the moment it is the Summer holidays and we don't have anywhere else to practice.We were using amplified equipment, (x2 electric guitars & x1 bass) in addition to an acoustic drum kit. In my opinion we did not go that loud, just enough so that the guitars could be heard to a decent extent, while the drum kit was playing.We did have the upstairs practice room ventalated via window during the practice, but shut it for a while after the 1st complaint.As a band we want to know what the UK laws are for playing in a residential area. We have heard that your allowed to play at non-health damaging volume, to the neighbors, and your allowed to play to a decent volume to 11PM.We dont want to annoy the residents, but its not like were doing it everyday, its just an occasional thing, every say 6 weeks. We were playing at a reasonable volume, during the practice. I play even louder at home sometimes and I have never got a complaint.So what can I say in my defence, as we havent done anything wrong, its just plain old croutchy neighbors.

The manager told me that his ex-colleague left because he moved for a total different city, this is not true (this guy is going to the same gym where I go)I think that the text message that I sent to Carphone Warehouse Customer Servise regarding whether I was happy or not with the service provided from the sales staff caused the dismissal of this sales agentthe first time I went back to the store was 13 days after (that is within the cancelation period) in which I complained to the manager the conduct of his colleague (whose had already left the company) this manager called Vodafone for me to add international calls on my contract but I didn't agree because it was to expensiveWhen I realised I've been sold the most expensive and worst plan (because I have problem also with signal coverage) I went back to the store and I asked to change my Vodafone plan to Orange plan the manager told me that if I had problem with signal coverage I had to come back to the store within 14 days and he showed me a different paper, which was not the contract that I signed, where reported the 14 days to change my plan if the coverage was not good.On the defence they have written that I had 14 days to cancel my agreement but I can't read anywhere on the contract about it, instead the 14 days on the reverse of my contract is about to return any equipment in case of cancelattion of the contract in addition it says 14 WORKING days and about cancellation it says 7 working daysWhen I went back the second time in the store they tried to cheat me by showing me the reverse of the contract that I signed and telling me that the 14 days to cancell my agreement was written there, believing that I can't read in EnglishAt the end Carphone Warehouse Customer Service by phone call tried to reach an agreement by making me an offer but I was not agree with it, however we fixed an appointment inside the store where also Carphone Warehouse Customer Service whould been involved, but when I got the store the manager refused to help meany suggestion to help me with my Telephone Mediaton will be very appreciatedthank you in advance for your help"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "16/07/12 22:27", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "If they don't provide you with enough time (14 days) to inspect the documents, then they can't be used in court.

One of her sisters has hated me all my life, for no good reason. When my mother began to lose her marbles, her sisters decided to help her by managing her money. They took \u00a350,000 out of her bank account.

It was all I had to rely on to bring justice, as I did not have any money to cover legal costs.I have heard nothing from the Probate Registry since the day I registered the Caveat, 9th April 2009.Today I called the Probate Registry to ask if anything had happened.

The house is owned 50/50. I paid all legal fees and the full deposit. While we were together I made all mortgage payments and he paid all household bills. In March 2012 we split up and he moved into a private rented flat. He has not contributed to the mortgage at all since he left.At first things were amicable between us but then he became very angry and agitated which escalated resulting in me going to the police and having a harrassment order issued against him. I am now keen to deal with the house in order to cut all ties with him.I believe the house is currently in negative equity by about \u00a310,000. I would like to keep the house on myself and continue with the mortgage and I would like to find out legally who is entitled to what (which I imagine is that we are both entitled to half of everything). Theonly communication I have had from my ex in regards to the house is that he wanted me to sell it and we would both have to live with the debt of the negative equity which I find absurd- surely there are other options which could benefit us both instead of leaving us in debt. At the very least would I be entitled to get my deposit back, or would this go towards repaying the negative equity?I am very willing to negotiate with my ex to reach an agreement with him but doubt he will be willing to do the same. If by any chance he agreed to sign the house over to me would I be obliged to give him a payout or would it be a good idea to offer him something as a 'sweetner'?Does the fact that I paid all legal fees and the deposit, along with the fact that he chose to leave the home and has not been paying half of the mortgage since give me any advantage over him? Also wouldthe fact that he has been intimidating and had a police caution to stay away from me put any weight behind my case?Any information or advice would be greatly welcomed.

At the time we were living in a house owned outright by his mother and himself (she lived in an annexe on the side). Setting up the business meant having a lease on 2 coaches. My husband and i both signed for them. I didn't realise at the time that it was a personal guarantee i was signing, and certainly didnt know that there was such a thing as a blanket personal guarantee, and we also had life insurance built into the policy , which i have since found out was only on the first two leases. Two years later i expressed my concerns about loosing the house so took mother in law to the solicitors to get the house put into her name. Since then my husband has part exchanged these coaches for newer ones and he now has 5. We put the house into out 3 names because of my mother-in-laws failing health, then I found out last year that my personal guarantee still stands so our house is at risk if anything happens to the company. Things have become so bad between myself and my husband and i really want to get myself and my daughter out of here. I would like to divorce him, my mother in law is now in a nursing home which is being paid for by the nhs. I am trapped here because of my personal guarantees. If i move out or tell him i want a divorce i will have no job, so can't rent and i am not eligble for any benefits because i have equity in the house. I have told him numerous times i am not happy with the whole situation but he just tells me how he couldn't manage without me and then carries on refinancing and upgrading the coaches. If i question anything he tells me how he has had enough and threatens to hand the keys back to the finance company, so if i walked out now i would be responsible for the collapse of the company therefore would probably loose the equity in my house which at present stands at approx \u00a3200,000 (enough to buy a small property for myself and my daughter to live in, without a mortgage)Can anyone please tell me how i can get out of my personal guarantees. My husband is not the kind of person you argue with and is very controlling. I didn't know what i was signing at the time and had no assets at the time,and was certainly not advised to get seperate legal advice or given advice without my husband being present. I now have half a house at risk and feel i am being held hostage here by the personal guarantees. He is just about to sign up for yet another coach!I have looked into etridge and think it would apply but am not sure if it applies to an asset finance company and would they fight it? and how much would it cost? would i be able to claim back the costs? how long would it take?My situation seems so unfair, I have been looking for a way out for years now and its starting to affect my health. I feel my only way out is to walk away from everything i have worked for. I have sacrificed a career of my own to help my husband so i have no qualifications and i know getting a job is not going to be easy and where do i go?Would appreciate any advice.ThanksDi"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "01/06/12 13:34", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/pair-shoes-louboutin-shoes-sale", "1.Init_Post": "Shopping is just something that boosts up the moods of many.

My new employer has just been lazy and copied my old contract without reading it, other employees at the firm havecontracts that state they are only entitled to statutory sick pay, so it's an obvious mistake and one they are trying to get out of.My question is, am I entitled to contractual sick pay as per my contract? And, if so, how do I enforce my employer to pay it? They have offered me the option of signing a new contract with SSP 9as per other employees)to 'clarify' the situation, but I believe I am entitled to the sick pay and I took the job based on the contract saying so.Sorry to go on, bu I hope someone can offer help on this matter, any advice or input is more than welcome.Thanks guys,Chris."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "21/05/12 10:51", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/drug-driving", "1.Init_Post": "  Normal\n  0  false\n  false\n  false  EN-GB\n  X-NONE\n  AR-SA  MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 /* Style Definitions */\n table.MsoNormalTable\n\t{mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\";\n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;\n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0;\n\tmso-style-noshow:yes;\n\tmso-style-priority:99;\n\tmso-style-qformat:yes;\n\tmso-style-parent:\"\";\n\tmso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;\n\tmso-para-margin-top:0cm;\n\tmso-para-margin-right:0cm;\n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt;\n\tmso-para-margin-left:0cm;\n\tline-height:115%;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:11.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Calibri\",\"sans-serif\";\n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;\n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;\n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;}This problem is getting out of control in the UK when will we decide it has to be zero tolerance.:("}, {"2.Time_Posted": "20/05/12 18:46", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/when-can-costs-not-be-awarded-case-thanks", "1.Init_Post": "I was told that everyone has a right to seek justice, and the that costs cannot be applied if that is what you are seeking.

The soil/waste pipe of this property, instead of exiting out into the front to join the sewer pipe in the road in which it is built (as the other properties in the same road, which were built in the 1970s, do), it runs (underground) down the rear of the property and enters my back garden.It then runs diagonally across and then down the side of my property where it joins the soil/waste pipe from my property. The combined waste from both properties then goes through the soil pipe located down the side of my front garden into the sewer pipe in the road.I can track the route by the inspection manholes in my garden (nb. There have been no problems relating to this pipe in the 25 years I have lived here).What I suspect has happened is that the older property originally had a cess pit and when the houses in my road were built the owners took advantage of the new sewage pipe system being laid there and ran a soil pipe as I have detailed above.Ironically, if the owners had waited, new properties were later built aside the older property in its own road with a sewage system so it needn't have gone the route that it did.My question is: Who is responsible for my neighbour's soil pipe from where it enters my garden to where it joins my soil pipe? Someone told me that it is a shared responsibility but I fail to see why I should be responsible in this way. Or since the 2011 changes in responsibility, is it the Water Board's? I obtained the land registration documents and while these clearly say the owners of houses on the estate have to allow the company building the new houses on the estate to lay pipes etc across their gardens, this does not (presumably) apply to any houses not built by these builders and so that requirement cannot apply to the older property behind me which was built long before the estate was. There is also nothing in the land registry documents about the neighbour's soil pipe. Someone also told me that as its been there so long, they have established \u2018a right of way'.All I want to know is what responsibilities and what rights I have in respect of this pipe as several acquaintances have suggested I need .to clarify the situation.If anyone can shed any light, I would be very grateful.Thank you.Ray"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "17/05/12 22:43", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/inheritance-1", "1.Init_Post": "my grandfather has decided that\nwhen he passed away, myself and my\nsister are to recieve our deceased\nmothers share of his money and\nmoney from sale of home, so we\nshare a fourth as he had 3 living\nchildren. there are a few accounts\ntotalling about 65-000cash and\ngrandad was not in debt, but as a\nfamily we are unsure weather to keep\nhis home or sell it,.my aunt has been\nmade executor and all assets are inhands of solicitor. my question is,as\nfamily are unsure of weather we want\nto sell grandads home will soliciter\nshare the cash assets then ( if we\ndecide to sell ) seperatley share the\nhouse value or does house need to\nbe sold before anythings shared out?"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "17/05/12 22:42", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/inheritance-0", "1.Init_Post": "my grandfather has decided that\nwhen he passed away, myself and my\nsister are to recieve our deceased\nmothers share of his money and\nmoney from sale of home, so we\nshare a fourth as he had 3 living\nchildren. there are a few accounts\ntotalling about 65-000cash and\ngrandad was not in debt, but as a\nfamily we are unsure weather to keep\nhis home or sell it,.my aunt has been\nmade executor and all assets are inhands of solicitor. my question is,as\nfamily are unsure of weather we want\nto sell grandads home will soliciter\nshare the cash assets then ( if we\ndecide to sell ) seperatley share the\nhouse value or does house need to\nbe sold before anythings shared out?"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "10/05/12 21:45", "4.Discussion": [{"a.Discussion_Post": "Hi, My question here is, is the house in joint names? You dont have to move out if you don't want to: 1. This is because if you are the legal owner, you are entitled legally to remain in occupation, 2. also, because there are no dependants children in the marriage currently living at home and no violence which would determine the situation that, children witnessing violence between you and your wife will in the future affect their welbeing therefore, moving out will be in their best interest. Further, if your accident has caused you less mobility and the matrimonial home has been abducted to suit your movement (if this is the situation), then it will be wise that she find herself an acommodation elsewhere to live, maybe with her current partner. If you are joint owners of the property (as you may know), then both you and your wife are legally entitled to remain in occupation. Therefore she cannot be forced to move out of the matrimonial home and it is against the law to change the locks.  If the mortgage is in joint names, I highly recommend speaking to her to make a contribution towards the mortgage repayments. This way, you are rest assured that the monthly repayments can be met and avoid the risk of the property being reposessed in the near future. Lastly, you own your home and therefore you are entitled to ask anyone you like to visit you. To keep divorce amicable, I would advice you talk to your wife about who is coming to visit you and when they will be expected to leave. If matters cannot be agreed between you and your wife, I highly recommend you take the route of mediation.

We lived in the UK for 20 yrs and moved home to Ireland just over 10yrs ago. We built our own house,well i did because that was my profession. My wife works in the medical profession .Its a full time,well paid professional,pensionable job. The house is not adapted to suit my disability as its my upper limb thats mainly affected . The stress of this injury has also brought on other medical issues,such as asthma and sleep apnea. As i have been self employed for many years it would be almost impossible for me to find gainful employment in my trade due to both my injuries and other related conditions. I am 47 yrs old and my wife is 48 yrs old. All my earnings since we seperated are now gone. My wife considers what ive earned in the last few yrs as our money but yet her wages are all her own. the money i earned in the last 6yrs came from a property developement on a site adjacent to our own home,so the land was jointly owned. However i enacted the project,i did not draw a wage at the time,only expenses and i continued to pay all our household bills. I bought her a new car also and she paid all her personal credit cards out of these earnings. What was left i used to renovate an empty property in the UK that we owned since before we moved home. I spent 12months there working the project and when completed rented it out. This is also jointly owned and we agreed that i would draw my wage from the rent untill such time as my labour was covered. We shared the family home all these years without much hassle to be honest. Right up untill a few months after i was hospitalised the 1st time,everything was relatively ok. Our youngest son was causing a bit of bother at this time also which lead to a few rows between my wife and I. I left for awhile as she asked to me due to the situation with my son had become tense. This so happens to be the same time as the cash began to deplete. Coincidence perhaps but im not so sure.  I moved back a cpl months ago as the situation with my son got completely out of control and needed to be there. Its been an impossible situation since. Ive made to feel like  an intruder in my own house. Ultimatley i would like to hold on to the family home in our divorce . There is a mortgage on the family home, there is no mortgage on the rented property. Her offer is i take the rented property and she has the family home. She hates where our family home is,its where i grew up not her and all my family live there and its home to all my work tools and workshop . Should i ever be able to work my trade in the future this is where i need to be. I have offered that she take the rented property but refinance it and pay off money owed on family home as i am unemployed and on disabilty potentially for a very long time. The rent would pay the refincance back and she would still have her income to live on. She refused. She wants the family home because potentially it could be worth more than the rented property when the property market picks up. This could take 10 yrs but she wants to sell it to profit. I want to live in it . I built it,our dream house. Its my home to me. How can i hold on to it and be able to afford it. Is it futile to even try persue this option.Does my wife have an obligation towards me same as i would to her if she were the dependant spouse ?   regards,   f", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "15/05/12 00:50"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "Hi, I believe that you reside in Ireland.

It sets out the rights of, and your responsibilities to, employees and job applicants. However, it is important to bear in mind that many of these rights and responsibilities apply equally to other workers you may also have in your workplace, including:Agency staff.Self-employed consultants. Your business must not treat an employee or job applicant   her pregnancy; or an illness she has suffered as a result of her pregnancy This protection lasts from when her pregnancy begins until the end of her maternity leave or, if earlier, when she returns to work.  Your employees are entitled to reasonable paid time off for ante-natal appointments during working hours. Your business is entitled to ask for evidence of an appointment, other than the first one (for example, the appointment card).  A specific risk assessment should be carried out for all pregnant employees, whatever their job description. To qualify for leave, your employee must let your business know, at least 15 weeks before the week her baby is due, that: she is pregnant;the week her baby is due; andthe date she wants to start her maternity leave. Generally, she cannot start this earlier than 11 weeks before her baby is due.  Your business must not treat an employee  because she is on   To qualify, an expectant mother must have 26 weeks continuous service with your business at 15 weeks before the week her baby is due.  During maternity leave a new mother can work for up to ten days for your business without losing her entitlement to maternity pay or bringing her maternity leave to an end. This can include training or any other activity connected with \"keeping in touch\" with the workplace. Your business is not obliged to offer KIT days and an employee is not required to accept any that are offered to her.  If a redundancy situation arises within your business during an employee's maternity period, that employee has the right to be offered any suitable vacancy  it is offered to any other employee.  A new mother has the right to request and for you to consider flexible working conditions (for example, a change to the hours they work).   A specific risk assessment should be carried out for all new mothers, whatever their job description.  A new mother has right to return to her old job, or a similar job with equivalent status, once her maternity leave has ended (unless there is a redundancy situation).Your business is prohibited from victimising a job applicant, employee or previous employee because they have made or intend to make a pregnancy or maternity leave related discrimination complaint.Pregnancy and maternity discrimination may be permitted in certain limited circumstances. For example, your business may be allowed to treat women differently to comply with legislation (such as health and safety legislation) designed to protect pregnant employees and new mothers. If one of your employees discriminates against another employee, your business may be liable unless you have taken reasonable steps to prevent the conduct taking place (for example, by having a policy or procedure in place that covers the particular conduct). The offending employee may also be liable.Your business could also be liable for the harassment of your employees by a third party (for example, customers or visitors) in some circumstances.If a job applicant or employee succeeds in a claim for pregnancy or maternity discrimination, an employment tribunal will generally award compensation (including a sum for injury to feelings). There is  on the amount of compensation that can be awarded. Litigation can involve significant management time and costs, which are usually not recoverable.A claim against your business is likely to create negative publicity. It is better to avoid getting involved in a claim, than attempting to manage a crisis after a claim has been made.

Last September, twelve months from the start of the tenancy and ten months from its likely end, there were some building works carried out which left behind some plaster dust and other muck that the tenants asked to be cleaned away. The complaint about the mess was made to the letting agent, and the agency's contracted cleaner was sent to clean up.Owing to confusion, the cleaner went along thinking that the property had been vacated and that the house needed to be prepared for letting to new tenants, and removed nearly all possessions left in the common areas (kitchen, lounge, downstairs corridor, upstairs hallway, downstairs toilet, upstairs shower room) which did not appear on the inventory apart from some cutlery and crockery.When they attempted to recover the items by contacting the letting agent two days later, they were informed that all the items had been disposed of. When asked for itemised compensation of \u00a3575, the letting agency demanded proof of every item having been there despite all remaining receipts having been removed by the cleaner. There was virtually no wastage/depreciation on the items as the bulk was comprised of food and toiletries which were newly bought, the tenancy having recently restarted after two months on half-rent for the summer. Some other items (like a miniature vacuum cleaner, a Vauxhall wheel trim, small pieces of kitchen equipment and a Christmas tree stand) have been requested for refund at the lowest possible cost at which they could be replaced.Would anybody please be able to offer advice as to what remedies there are, as the tenants naturally do not have any proof to produce.

The items which we did agree upon are still available and I have offered him 3 dates to organise a courier to collect them but he hasn't bothered. However he produced a further list of items 2yrs after our separation which included items he had given me as gifts and worse still completely fabricated items that I never had. He has inflated the original cost for the actual items that do exist and the overall figure he is claiming from me is around \u00a33,000. I par-took in a mediation hearing this week where I offered the return of the original items agreed upon at my cost but he rejected this offer, he is pursuing his full claim against me. I am at a loss to how I could ever agree to return items that he has fabricated and is it the law that an item given as a gift can be claimed back? Also could anyone explain to me what having the right to have the order set aside, varied or stayed means please and if it is recommended for me to try this? I really would like to avoid having to come face to face with him in a court as he intimidates me and I would find the whole event incredibly stressful.I would be very gratefull to anyone those has any advice or has been in a similar situation"}, {"2.Time_Posted": "19/03/12 20:40", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/email-prosecution", "1.Init_Post": ""}, {"2.Time_Posted": "12/03/12 14:33", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/net-lawman-uk-legal-document-providing-company", "1.Init_Post": "Net Lawman offers a wide range of legal documents, agreements, contracts, forms etc, for different businesses, companies, individuals etc,.

Here is my reply:-   Once the final route of HS2 has been decided the government must make arrangements to safeguard the route. In order to safeguard the route, the Secretary of State must issue directions under the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 (SI 1995/419). These directions are given to local planning authorities and are designed to protect the route corridors. Once the directions are made, when a third party makes a planning application which affects the route, the local planning authority must notify certain bodies including, in this case, the Secretary of State for Transport. These bodies can then assess the impact of the proposed development on the   route and recommend that planning permission should either be refused or granted.  HS2 \n Compensation payable for the property will be determined under the provisions generally applicable where land is compulsorily acquired under the Land Compensation Act 1961. Compensation for disturbance eg costs of moving will also be payable.     Section 10 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965   The government will proceed with this project as you know by way of a hybrid bill. We can lobby the government so that they come to the view that their proposals are not based on proper argument or fact. Petitions can be presented to the select committee appointed by Parliament after the bill has had it's second reading.

After all Theresa Villiers having given an initial address immediately left the room to be replaced by Philip Hammond only at the very end of the meeting \u2013 both representatives of DAFT (Private Eye\u2019s acronym not mine) therefore failing to hear any of the proceedings. Nevertheless in the interim we were treated to excellent presentations from:- Chris Stokes \u2013 Former Director of the Strategic Rail Authority \u2013 who demolished the business case for HS2. Professor Mike Geddes who spoke on the lack of wider economic benefits of the scheme Mark Sullivan \u2013 CPRE - who dealt with alternative versions of high speed rail Joe Rukin who told us that speed is not green I am sure you will all have heard or read the transcripts of these speeches which taken together make the definitive and compelling case against HS2. It has been reported that the number of MPs who attended was in the region of 20 which in my opinion was disappointing on the basis that all MPs had been invited to attend. Ms Villiers was at pains to point out that HS2 is \"not a done deal\". The coming consultation, she said, will examine \"the very principle of whether high speed rail lines should be built\". If you thought this was a major concession then you would be wrong since Ms Villiers\u2019 weasel words were exposed later in her address when she stated that the Government\u2019s \"objective IS to achieve royal assent before the end of this Parliament and to begin enabling work shortly thereafter\" (my emphasis \u2013 no \" would be\" about it). Philip Hammond provided no comfort either although he was challenged by the Speaker John Bercow who detected in recent speeches by the advocates of HS2 less reliance on the business case and a greater emphasis on the vague concept of national interest. Mr Hammond\u2019s condescending reply reiterated the change to the economic and social geography of the country to be achieved by HS2 and again called in aid \"the national interest\" without providing any substance to these remarks. He among other points also made the remarkable allegation that the route already announced actually followed the existing transport corridors, promoting howls of derision from the assembled throng. There was however in my opinion one highly significant event which if nothing else justified the meeting. After the address by Mr Stokes Iain Stewart MP a member of the Transport Select Committee admitted that he was not aware of the arguments which had been advanced against HS2 and was extremely interested to hear them. Indeed he himself called for a transcript. It is somewhat disturbing that a member of the Committee has not heard or read the evidence which HS2AA say has already been submitted. This alone shows the value of Monday\u2019s gathering where arguments can be forcefully face to face made to those in ignorance. We owe a big thanks to Jo and Lizzie for arranging this.   \n", "b.Discussion_Post_Time": "30/10/10 19:05"}, {"a.Discussion_Post": "Birmingham - the third Heathrow runway.

The loss of Hyde Farm and Chapel Farm would be a great shame, but could possibly be justified if HS2 were going the benefit the nation as a whole. That's the problem: there is little benefit but huge cost. In real money, the line will run at a loss. Only if intangible benefits are given an inflated monetary value does HS2 even start to look financially attractive.

Ministers believe that these are mutually compatible with the aims of the planning system to protect the natural environment and promote sustainable growth, which will form the basis of planning policy reforms (to be contained within the forthcoming National Planning Policy Framework).The White Paper includes plans to consult on the proposals for green areas and aims to introduce the powers to designate by April 2012. It suggests that green spaces should be identified in neighbourhood plans and local plans which \u2018complement and do not undermine investment in homes, jobs and other essential services'.In theory, there seems to be nothing to stop local people using this mechanism for ulterior motives, such as to prevent a specific unwanted potential development in the early stages of a planning application. The White Paper does not stipulate what factors will need to be considered in deciding whether the land could be designated, but presumably there will need to be established criteria, particularly to ensure that \u2018investment in homes, jobs and other essential services' is not undermined, which could be difficult to ascertain or control.The new powers to designate could also provide an opportunity for local people to secure green space for recreational use where they fail to satisfy the criteria to register the land as a town or village green. Land can be registered as a town or village green if it has been used by inhabitants of the locality for sports or recreational use as of right for at least 20 years.

However, the Court of Appeal interpreted sections 213 and 213 of the Act to mean that once a tenancy ends, ex-tenants cannot bring a claim under the penalty rule.\"The judgment says that once the tenancy has ended, the tenant no longer has any status to bring a claim a for a deposit penalty,\" Gallagher explains. \"And the landlord cannot protect the deposit anymore because there isn't a live tenancy and protected deposits can only be accepted when a tenancy exists.\"The problem is tenants often only become aware their deposits are unprotected towards the end of the tenancy. So it's quite likely that before the tenant realises they have a claim the tenancy would have ended.\"He says this decision and  have now ridden a coach and horses through the whole purpose of the legislation. \"In  the court ruled that a landlord does not have to protect a deposit within 14 days or be subject to the three times penalty, all as required by the Act. The court concluded that the purpose of the Act was to make sure a deposit was protected. That could be achieved without penalty if the landlord protects the deposit at any time up to the court hearing in relation to the deposit not being protected.\"The upshot of these two decisions is that landlords no longer have any incentive to protect deposits.\"He says Shelter had lobbied the government over time to address the poor drafting of the Act which has precipitated the two rulings. As a result the Localism Bill may contain relevant amendments. \"The government accepted our criticism that sections213 and 214 of the Act have flaws. Their view was that the courts would sort that out. They have done that but not in the way the government expected. We have raised the issue in the form of an amendment to the Localism Bill and the government has supported that.\"However the Bill will take another year to implement and it is unclear whether the amendment would continue the current penalty system, he adds.In the meantime, tenants would be well-advised to ensure their deposit has been protected. \"Most landlords do protect deposits but there is an appreciable minority who don't and it's for their benefit the legislation is designed.

They had planning permission for a development to include dwellings and had already commenced development. They continued to carry out works following the commencement of proceedings by various objectors.For the application to succeed the tribunal had to be satisfied that:- money would be an adequate compensation for any loss or disadvantage caused by discharge or modification, and- either the restriction did not secure to the beneficiaries any practical benefits of substantial value or advantage, or- was contrary to the public interest.The Lands Tribunal refused the application. The proposed development was a reasonable user of the land. It was difficult to say that it was not in the face of the planning permission. The fact that 124 dwellings was 14 more than recommended in the inspector's report on the relevant local plan did not matter. His figure was an approximation only, the report dated from 2003 and subsequently planning officers advised that it was necessary to increase the density recommended by him to reach the lowest density threshold for new residential developments set out in PPG3. The covenant impeded that reasonable user.However, the restriction did secure practical benefits to the objectors of substantial value and advantage. In respect of the properties that would be most affected, the proposed modification would result in a reduction in value ranging from 7.5% to 15%. The applicant, therefore, failed to prove the relevant ground on that basis. In addition, the covenant by impeding the proposed development secured to the owners of two other properties the benefits of allaying their reasonable concerns about intensified flooding and relatively high density of development than existing at present. Those practical benefits were also of substantial advantage.The Tribunal went on to confirm that even if Wimpey and the housing association had succeeded in proving the ground, it was unlikely that it would have exercised its discretion to modify the covenant. The extensive works that Wimpey had carried out were not an inadvertent action resulting from the discovery of the covenant at a late stage in the development programme. They were the result of a deliberate strategy of forcing through the development, in the face of many objections from the beneficiaries of the covenant, to the point where it had so changed the appearance and character of the land that the Tribunal would be persuaded to allow them to continue with the development. The Tribunal made it clear that it was not inclined to reward parties who deliberately flout their legal obligations in this way."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "06/04/11 17:29", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/consumers-warned-over-deregulation-legal-services", "1.Init_Post": "Legal ombudsman says consumers must take greater care when choosing a legal practitioner following market reforms in October."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "04/04/11 13:19", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/sound-justice-against-proposed-cuts-legal-aid-0", "1.Init_Post": "The planned cuts would mean over half a million people each year facing real legal issues will find themselves unrepresented and ultimately \u2018silenced in court'.The Law Society has been meeting with the Ministry of Justice, lobbying MPs and taking advice from specialist solicitors to prepare its response to the government proposals.The Law Society is now asking the public to join its campaign and will continue to make noise around the proposed cuts until MPs cast their vote on legislation.The proposed cuts will take \u00a3350 million out of the Legal Aid budget.

Access to justice needs to be both fair and efficient with the system free of waste, unnecessary bureaucracy and expenditure.4. The courts, their officers, suppliers and contractors have a duty to manage the judicial process with fairness and efficiency.5.

The requirements can be split between those that are \"essential\" for the job and those that are merely \"desirable\".Ensure that none of the requirements in either document discriminates against any groups of employees. In particular, consider whether any requirements for specific qualifications, working hours or times, travel, age ranges or dress are necessary for the job in question.Consider whether the job needs to be full-time or whether it is open to part-time, home working, flexible working or job sharing. If you specify that the job is full-time, you may need to be able to justify your decision.Decide whether you want the job to be advertised internally, externally or both.Consider using specialist publications, websites and agencies to target different communities, ages and sexes.Think carefully when writing the advert. Protection from discrimination because of a protected characteristic (age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation) covers all areas of employment, including job adverts. For example, avoid using language that might imply only someone of a certain age would be suitable (for example, \"mature\" experienced\" or \"young\"). Ensure any employees absent from work (including women on maternity leave or those on long-term sick leave) are informed of the vacancy to enable them to apply. Failure to do so could amount to discrimination.Using a standard application form will allow your business to directly compare individual applicants' answers against the selection criteria more easily and help avoid potential unlawful discrimination claims.Draw up a shortlist using the same criteria used in the job description and person specification. Every applicant should be marked against the same criteria to help avoid any potential unlawful discrimination claims.If your business is making redundancies you must consider applications for suitable vacancies from employees selected for redundancy ahead of external applicants. Women selected for redundancy while on maternity leave are entitled to be offered a suitable alternative vacancy (where one is available) in priority to other potentially redundant employees.Think when and where the interview should take place. For example:check whether the interview venue has access for disabled candidates;holding an interview during a religious holiday could discriminate against applicants from that particular religion; orcandidates with children may require the interview to be conducted at a particular time.Ideally, all shortlisted candidates should be asked the same or similar questions to allow you to compare their answers and avoid the possibility of a discrimination claim.You should not ask any questions about the candidates' personal life unless they are directly relevant to the requirements of the job (for example, it is unacceptable to ask a female candidate whether she plans to have children).Keep a paper trail throughout the process to demonstrate how your business reached its decision to select the successful candidate. This should include:selection criteria;notes on the short listing process;interview questions; notes of panellists' assessments of the interviewees.It is good practice to provide feedback to unsuccessful candidates if it is requested. A failure to do so could indicate your decision was based on discriminatory grounds.Make a written offer to the successful candidate. Consider whether to set a time limit for acceptance and specify that acceptance should be in writing.Your business can make the offer conditional on a range of criteria, provided they are not discriminatory. For example:providing satisfactory references; orconfirmation that the employee is free to work in the UK or has an appropriate work permit or immigration approval to work.Before making a job offer, make sure the applicant confirms they are not bound by any restrictive covenants from their previous job; otherwise your business could be sued by their former employer. Restrictive covenants are uConsider whether the contract should be permanent or for a fixed term. If you decide a fixed-term contract is appropriate, you may need to justify why your business reached that decision.Remember that an employee on a fixed-term or part-time contract should not be treated any less favourably than a permanent employee (for example, they should be allowed access to a company bonus scheme or instead receive an equivalent benefit).Your business can include a probationary period in the contract. This will enable you to assess the employee and vice versa. It also gives you the flexibility to dismiss someone using a shorter notice period of at least one week.Probationary periods typically last between three to six months and can be extended with the consent of the employee at the end of the term (for example, if the employee was sick and your business was unable to adequately assess their performance, you may want to extend the period).

It also highlights the additional obligations your business owes to consumers when selling goods online, by telephone or by mail order. Consumers are people who buy for purposes not related to their trade, business or profession. They have a greater choice of remedies than trade buyers.Certain terms are implied into  contract for the sale of goods and cannot be excluded in consumer contracts. In particular, goods must: For example, a dish that is described as \"ovenproof\", but shatters when used under the normal conditions for making a casserole, will not correspond with its description. Quality includes:state, condition and fitness for all purposes which goods of that kind are commonly supplied;appearance and finish; anddurability.Your business could be protected if:you draw the consumer's attention to unsatisfactory quality before the contract is made;the consumer examines the goods before the contract is made and finds (or should have found) a defect.A consumer cannot hold your business responsible:for fair wear and tear.for misuse or accidental damage by the consumer.where consumers tried their own repair or had someone else attempt a repair and this damaged the goods.A consumer has four remedies when products do not conform to the contract for sale: Consumers can reject the goods and request their money back, provided they complain within a reasonable time. A consumer can claim damages, which will generally equate to the cost of repair or replacement of the goods. They may also be able to claim compensation for damage caused by faulty goods (for example, where a washing machine leaked). If buyers have accepted the goods, their only remedy is damages. If a consumer requests a repair or replacement, your business will need to carry them out within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the consumer. Your business can refuse to repair the goods if the cost would be disproportionately higher than the cost of the replacement (or vice versa).A consumer can request a full or partial refund. Your business is entitled to request proof of purchase (for example, a till receipt or a credit card statement). Consumers do not have to accept credit notes when goods are faulty or not as described. The time limit for a consumer to bring a claim is six years (five years in Scotland). The date generally runs from the date the goods were sold, although there are some exceptions to this. The fact consumers have five or six years to bring a claim, in theory, does not mean all goods should last this long in practice.Consumers must take reasonable steps to mitigate their loss. For example, they should report faults as soon as possible, to make it easier for them to show the goods were inherently faulty at the point of sale and to prevent the goods from deteriorating further.There are four main obligations on your business when it sells goods online, by telephone or mail order. They are:To provide up front information to consumers before the contract is concluded. To provide certain information to consumers before the delivery of the goods or supply of the services requested. For example: a description of the main characteristics of the goods your business is offering; or the price of the goods your business is offering (including all taxes). To commit to deliver the goods within 30 days. To provide a seven (working) day cooling-off period, during which consumers can cancel the contract without penalty and . The only charge that can be made to consumers exercising their rights is the direct cost of returning the goods. If your business does not provide consumers with details about their right to cancel the contract, the period is extended . There are certain exceptions to these rules, such as the supply of products that, by their nature, may not be returned (for example, perishable food) or bespoke products."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "09/02/11 17:21", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/abolition-default-retirement-age", "1.Init_Post": "This checklist sets out the steps your business should take before the default retirement age (DRA) is abolished.The DRA of 65 was introduced in 2006. Removing it is seen as a way of encouraging people to work longer and save for retirement. The abolition of the DRA will not mean individuals can never be forced to retire. Businesses can compulsorily retire employees if they can objectively justify the decision, although this is likely to be the exception. The DRA will be abolished on .

This is on the basis that:The notification of retirement is issued by  (or by  if your business is relying on the \"short notice\" provisions).The date of retirement falls before .All requirements of the DRA procedure have been met.You should identify any imminent retirements within your business and check whether they are covered by the transitional arrangements. If you have already set in motion a retirement that does not follow the procedure (for example, because the dismissal will not take effect before 30 September 2011), you must revisit them. This could mean retracting a letter of dismissal and then following the DRA procedure.The last day your business can give the full six months' notice of dismissal under the DRA procedure.The last day your business can issue a notice of dismissal for retirement under the DRA procedure, using the \"short notice\" provisions, under which an employee can claim compensation (subject to a maximum of eight weeks' wages).The last day a dismissal for retirement can take effect under the DRA procedure. If your business decides to abandon a fixed retirement age, you should remove it from your contracts of employment and notify your staff of the change. Where the contract of employment is stated to terminate automatically on the person reaching the fixed retirement age, you should seek to vary the contract so your employees will have to provide the usual notice if they are resigning for retirement. Otherwise, your business will be unable to make appropriate preparations for that employee's departure.If your business decides to retain a fixed retirement age, you should be able to demonstrate that, before making your decision you:Identified the business needs that are met by having a fixed retirement age.Considered whether there were other ways of meeting this aim. Review share scheme and any associated documents and consider whether the \"good leaver\" and \"bad leaver\" provisions need amending, in particular, whether retirement is defined flexibly enough to include retirement in the absence of the DRA or retirement through choice.If age is currently a factor in your business' recruitment decisions, this must change. For businesses where there is no fixed retirement age, you will no longer be able to refuse to consider candidates on the basis they are almost 65 or over. Your business will be allowed to withdraw or withhold certain benefits to employees aged 65 or over. For example:Life assurance.Medical insurance.Permanent health insurance.Make sure appraisal and performance management processes are tightened up so older workers do not receive greater scrutiny than other employees. Deal with any performance issues as soon as they arise to protect your business from allegations that older workers are being singled out.Ensure conversations about employees' future plans are built in to your appraisal process. Only asking older workers about their plans could be seen as discriminatory. Adjust the promotion expectations of younger workers if the retirement age in your business is raised or removed altogether.Even if an employee has indicated they want to retire in the future, they are free to change their mind up until the point they have given notice to terminate their contract."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "06/02/11 18:17", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/landlords-beware-tenants-take-note", "1.Init_Post": ""}, {"2.Time_Posted": "06/02/11 18:13", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/silent-calls-be-severely-fined", "1.Init_Post": ""}, {"2.Time_Posted": "06/02/11 18:11", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/charities-now-need-music-licence", "1.Init_Post": ""}, {"2.Time_Posted": "06/02/11 18:09", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/oft-investigation-e-books", "1.Init_Post": ""}, {"2.Time_Posted": "04/02/11 13:59", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/stamp-duty-avoidance-schemes", "1.Init_Post": "If anyone is tempted into trying any of these schemes my advice would be to forget it.None of them areeffective and the taxman will be after you."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "23/01/11 20:20", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/appetite-suppressant-case-law", "1.Init_Post": "Hi, I'm a french student, and I have to do a research on appetite suppressant/diet pills US (and GB) case law.

It is a relatively low threshold and, therefore, an employment tribunal is likely to find it easy to conclude that a claimant suffered a substantial disadvantage.

Where TUPE applies, employees automatically transfer from one employer to another with their terms of employment and continuity of service intact.TUPE applies to a \"relevant transfer\". A relevant transfer can be where:A business or part of a business is sold.Work is outsourced from a client to a contractor.Outsourced services are transferred from the original contractor to another contractor.A client brings the outsourced services back in-house.Employees transfer to the new employer on their existing terms of employment and with all related employment rights, powers, duties and liabilities. Old age, invalidity and survivors' benefits under occupational pension schemes are excluded. The new employer steps into the shoes of the transferring employer in relation to the transferred employees. Any acts or omissions committed by the transferring employer are treated as having been done by the new employer.Employees who object to the transfer do not automatically transfer to the new employer. Their contracts will instead terminate on the transfer date.Any changes to an employee's terms of employment are void if the main reason for the change is either:The transfer itself.A reason connected with the transfer that is not an economic, technical or organisational reason requiring changes in the workforce (an ETO reason).However, it is possible to make changes to transferring employees' employment terms if the main reason is unconnected with the transfer or is connected with the transfer but is for an ETO reason.Employees are entitled to enhanced protection against unfair dismissal. Any dismissal of an employee with at least one year's service is automatically unfair where the main reason for the dismissal is either:the transfer itself; orA reason connected with the transfer that is not an ETO reason.This enhanced protection also applies if:an employee resigns in response to a serious breach of their contract; or their new employer makes a substantial change in the employee's working conditions which is detrimental to them.Employers can be ordered to reinstate, re-engage or compensate the dismissed employee if their complaint is upheld by an employment tribunal.Both parties involved in the transfer are obliged to inform and (if appropriate) consult recognised trade unions or elected employee representatives in relation to their own employees who may be affected by the transfer. If there are no existing representatives they must be elected by the affected employees for the purposes of consulting over the transfer.An individual employee has the right to bring a claim for breach of these requirements if an employer:fails to take any steps to invite employees to elect representatives; or in the absence of election, fails to give information to the affected employee.Certain information (for example, the reason for the transfer and where it is expected to take place) must be provided to the representatives long enough before the transfer to enable the transferring employer to consult with them about it. Although the duty to inform always arises, the duty to consult only arises where an employer envisages taking measures in relation to affected employees.Failing to comply with these obligations can expose both parties involved in the transfer to up to  . In certain circumstances, both parties can be held to be jointly and severally liable.The transferring employer must provide information (for example, the disciplinary and grievance records of the transferring employees) to the new employer not less than 14 days before the transfer takes place.If the transferring employer fails to comply with this duty, the new employer can apply for compensation based on the losses suffered, with a minimum award of  that the information was not provided for.To help the rescue of failing businesses, some key TUPE employment protections are relaxed if the transferring employer is insolvent.

The court stated that the misappropriation of the store room was \"one of the worst examples of its kind\". In this case, the defendant bricked up the door to the store room from the neighbours property and incorporated the store room into a flat that was being constructed by the defendant. The defendant ignored the neighbour's protests and only later asked its solicitors to check who owned the store room.Exemplary damages are awarded in excess of a claimant's loss and are intended to punish the defendant. In this case, the award was made to deter the defendant from repeating the same behaviour, as the court felt that making the business account for its modest profits of \u00a320,000 was not a sufficient deterrent. The court also wanted to award damages at a level that would have a significant impact on the defendant, whose weekly income was estimated at \u00a360,000.The overriding message from this decision is that ignoring the rights of the beneficial property owner can be very costly.

This checklist highlights the key issues that you need to consider.Redundancy can occur where a business decides to close or relocate, or if a business has a diminished requirement for employees to do work of a particular kind.Before selecting an employee for dismissal on the grounds of redundancy, your business must consider from which pool of employees redundancy selection should be made. Otherwise the dismissal is likely to be unfair.There are no fixed rules about how a redundancy pool should be defined. As long as your business can show that your choice of pool was reasonable in the circumstances, it will be difficult for an employee (or an employment tribunal) to challenge your decision.When considering the choice of pool, your business should start by asking two questions:Which particular kind of work is disappearing?Which employees do the particular kind of work that is disappearing?If there is a clear link between the kind of work that is disappearing and the group of employees doing that work, then the pool is likely to be easy to identify. Your business should also consider:The extent to which your employees are doing similar work.The extent to which employees' jobs are interchangeable.Whether the selection pool was agreed with union or employee representatives.Your business should look at the day-to-day activities of your employees and the terms of their contracts. You should concentrate on the reality of the situation, rather than what their contract says in theory they may be required to do. Identifying the pool becomes complicated if your employees are multi-skilled and do different types of work, or can be required to do different types of work under their contract of employment. In these cases, your employees are more likely to object to being labelled as redundant, particularly if they can point to other employees with whom they share interchangeable skills. It may be unreasonable for your business to identify one employee as being in the pool simply because they are doing a particular type of work that is disappearing, and ignore another employee doing different work where the first employee could just as easily do that other work. If an employee has previously done other work (other than the kind of work disappearing), it is likely that their skills are interchangeable with your other employees, and so a wider pool may be required.Where the work is \"low-skilled\", the skills are more likely to be regarded as interchangeable.Where an employee can point to another employee with interchangeable skills who also has less service than them, this may strengthen the argument that the other employee should be included in the pool.Your business is entitled to widen the selection criteria for redundancy beyond those employees that are directly affected by the redundancy situation. You can consider \"bumping\" out of their jobs employees whose roles are not redundant, to be filled by employees whose roles are redundant. There is no obligation on your business to consider \"bumping\", but you may fall foul of unfair dismissal law if it would have been reasonable to consider it in the circumstances.Your business may be reluctant to draw up a wide pool, even if it would be technically correct to do so, because of the impact that it could have on the morale of your employees. By identifying a narrow pool, or only consulting with those individuals provisionally selected for redundancy, you may be more vulnerable to claims of unfair dismissal. Your business must decide whether the risks to morale and other costs of widening the pool outweigh the risk (and cost) of claims.

It applies to any dispute or incident, whether started by you or brought against you (for example, a dispute with a trading partner or a prosecution by a regulatory body).It is very important to understand what your business is getting involved in. It is almost always better to find a commercial solution to a dispute. Your business should consider:The value of the claim, the costs involved and the commercial implications of success or failure. Even if your business wins, you will not recover all of the legal costs you have incurred.What your business is trying to achieve from the litigation process.The time, cost and management commitment involved, most of which is incurred early on in the process.How it will affect your ongoing commercial relationship.Whether the mere existence of a dispute will create difficulties in bidding for new business or otherwise adversely affect your business' reputation.Whether there is a commercial advantage to the dispute (for example, by showing that your business is serious about trademark infringement).What the effect will be for both parties if the dispute is made public.Whether the other party will be able to pay up if you win.All litigation is to some extent speculative (for example, how will the witnesses perform in the witness box?).Your business should not consider it a sign of weakness to approach the other side to explore the chances of a settlement. This can be done at any time during the litigation process, even during a trial. Settlement negotiations facilitated by a neutral third party (known as mediation) are increasingly popular. Always take legal advice first to ensure the settlement discussions are conducted on a \"without prejudice basis\". This means that anything said about the dispute during the settlement negotiations or in any written settlement offer cannot be used later at the trial. This protection only applies to statements made purely in an attempt to settle the case.Consider who should handle any negotiations. It is generally advisable to appoint one person with overall responsibility. If an offer is made, your business should consider its present-day value, bearing in mind how long it will take to get to trial and the potential cost of litigation.Your business should take legal advice as soon as possible after an incident occurs. If your business receives any formal documents requiring a response within a specified time, take legal advice immediately.Do not leave everything to the last minute. There are time limits your business needs to comply with. Ensure you:know which time limits apply; and have enough time to comply with them.Your business should not talk to the other party without having a lawyer present. You do not want to say something that may be used against you at a later date.Do not admit anything or agree to settle without taking legal advice. If your business is forced into a discussion without legal advice, you should not admit anything or agree to settle. Limit internal discussions to those with a real \"need to know\". However, ensure that anyone within your business with day-to-day contact with the other party is aware that there is a potential dispute.Do not communicate with any external party (for example, a trade association) without taking legal advice. Do not send documents relevant to the case to external parties or ask them to send them to you without taking legal advice.Your business should not destroy, delete or amend any documents or media containing information relevant to the case (for example, notes of conversations, diaries, e-mails, photographs or tapes).Suspend any routine destruction process that your business may have in place.Ensure everyone with access to information relevant to the case is immediately notified not to destroy it and to be careful when creating new documents.Your business may have to show embarrassing or damaging documents to the other party or the investigating body as part of the legal proceedings. Therefore, be very careful what you write:Consider whether you need to create a written document.Think about what you are writing and how it would appear if it was read out in court. Take legal advice first if it is likely to contain confidential or sensitive material (for example, if you think you might be in breach of a duty owed to others).Never speculate, offer opinions or make critical remarks: simply stick to the facts.Remember that e-mails are documents, just like letters.Only send the document or e-mail to those who really need to see it.Your business may have to implement improvements or changes in practices following an incident, implicitly showing your previous practice was flawed. Take legal advice to find the best way to do this without prejudicing any possible litigation.Communications between your business and your legal advisers do not usually have to be shown to the other side or regulatory body. They are protected by the legal concept of privilege and the lawyer's general duty of client confidentiality. Some communications are not protected. For example, you should take legal advice before marking documents \"privileged\" or \"confidential\". Using these terms on a document or copying it to a lawyer does not, in itself, make it privileged or confidential.Privilege and confidentiality can be lost if the privileged or confidential information is distributed or copied too widely. Only circulate it on a real \"need to know\" basis and never copy it externally without taking legal advice beforehand.Check your business' insurance policy to see if it is an insured claim. If it may be, notify your insurers immediately and follow their claims procedure, otherwise you could invalidate the insurance claim. Your business may need to seek the insurance company's consent before you take any action.Locate and preserve any relevant materials as soon as possible. Identify anyone who may be relevant to the case and, therefore, may have to give evidence. Are they still employed by your business, if not, can they be traced? Tell your legal advisers immediately if there is any reason they might not be able or willing to give a statement (for example, if they were dismissed or are ill).Tell your legal advisers if there is any other party who may be liable or should be involved in the case (for example, had you sub-contracted the disputed work?).Inform your legal advisers if you think the other party may dispose of its assets so that it cannot pay if you win. You may be able to obtain a court order to secure your claim. Also consider where the other party's assets are. Keep a record of management time taken by the case. Review how the case is going on a regular basis. Consult all areas of your business on which the dispute is likely to have an impact.

At the moment, a tenancy cannot be an assured tenancy if the rent is more than \u00a325,000 a year. These tenancies are known as \"common law tenancies\". Yes. An assured shorthold tenancy (AST) is a type of assured tenancy so the change will apply to an AST. ASTs are the most commonly used form of assured tenancy.Common law tenancies that were granted before 1 October 2010 with annual rents between \u00a325,000 and \u00a3100,000 that would otherwise have been ASTs (that is, tenancies that meet all the other requirements for being an AST, for example, not a business tenancy or a holiday let) will become ASTs on 1 October 2010.Landlords will need to comply with special rules that apply to ASTs, in particular:The duty to protect rent deposits.The procedures for gaining possession of the property.A landlord under an AST must protect the tenant's deposit by using an authorised tenancy deposit scheme (TDS) operated by an approved scheme administrator. There are significant penalties for failing to follow the correct procedures, including  and limitations on how the landlord can recover possession of the property.Landlords of existing tenancies that will become ASTs on 1 October 2010 should consider protecting any rent deposits taken before 1 October 2010. The requirement to protect deposits will only apply to ASTs granted after 6 April 2007. Generally speaking, a tenant under an AST has a greater degree of protection than that provided by a common law tenancy. Landlords of properties that were originally let on common law tenancies that become ASTs from 1 October 2010 should be especially careful to follow the correct procedure for gaining possession, regardless of the contractual terms of the tenancy.

In this context, businesses need to understand the potential implications of a prosecution for a breach of health and safety legislation.A conviction for a safety-related breach can have an immense impact on your business and the individuals within it. It is a criminal offence to breach the obligations contained within health and safety legislation. If a safety breach within a workplace causes a death, then those responsible may also face prosecution for gross negligence manslaughter (in the case of individuals) or corporate manslaughter (where the defendant is a business).Fines for the most serious safety breaches are now routinely in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Coupled with the need to pay not only your own legal costs but also the prosecutions', non-compliance with health and safety law is a costly exercise.Increasingly, companies look carefully at the safety record of potential business partners and requests for details of any safety convictions have become standard on tender questionnaires. The damage caused to your business' reputation by a criminal conviction could last longer than the initial financial outlay.When investigating safety breaches, inspectors routinely consider the role of individuals in workplace accidents. Although the level of fines imposed against individuals convicted may not be as large as a business, the potential impact on the individual can be severe.Individuals can be imprisoned for breaches of health and safety law, with sentences of up to six months in the Magistrates' Courts and up to two years in the Crown Courts. Even individuals that avoid a custodial sentence will have to live with the stigma of a criminal conviction, which could restrict their ability to work in certain industry sectors or travel abroad. There are a number of groups that can face prosecution for breaching health and safety requirements, these include: Employers (including limited companies, unincorporated associations, partnerships or individuals).The self-employed.Owners of premises used as a workplace.Individual employees.Designers, manufacturers, importers or suppliers of work equipment.The HSE has published a number of documents that set out how it will investigate and prosecute the health and safety breaches for which it is responsible. They set out the factors that the HSE considers will favour a prosecution, for example, where:Death was a result of a breach of legislation.There has been a reckless disregard of health and safety requirements.Inspectors have been intentionally obstructed in the course of their duties.False information has been supplied, or there was an intent to deceive, in relation to a matter which gives rise to a significant risk.In some less serious cases (for example, where it is a purely technical offence), it may be possible to influence the enforcing authority's decision to prosecute. This could be achieved in a number of ways, for example:Co-operation with the regulator's investigation.If appropriate, by accepting an invitation to send a representative of your business to an interview under caution or by providing written answers to questions under caution.Check whether your existing insurance policy includes legal expenses cover in the event of an investigation and a criminal prosecution being brought against your business for a safety-related breach.Many insurance companies have panels of preferred lawyers to whom they refer their insured for legal advice. Nevertheless, your business is entitled to be represented by the lawyer of your own choice. Most policies cover defence legal costs. However, if a number of individual members of staff are also prosecuted, the cover may not extend to all of them. Check whether your existing policy includes protection for your senior managers and directors.Although defence costs may be covered by such policies, any fine imposed on your business following conviction certainly will not be. Similarly, where the court orders the defendant to pay the prosecution's reasonable costs in bringing the case, these costs are rarely covered by business insurance."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "09/11/10 18:28", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/rights-light", "1.Init_Post": " A recent High Court case has provided a warning to developers to resolve any potential rights of light issues  starting development. In this particular case, the court awarded an injunction against a developer who infringed the rights of light to a neighbouring commercial property, despite the offending development having been completed.The decision throws into question the accepted view that it is difficult to obtain an injunction in relation to commercial buildings, particularly if the development has already been completed. You must not assume that rights of light can be bought out after the development has been completed, or that failure of potential claimants to act in a timely manner will prevent them obtaining an injunction. In this case, the injunction is likely to require alterations to the building at an estimated cost of between \u00a31 million to \u00a32 million.In simple terms, a right of light entitles the owner of the property to enough light to leave the property adequately lit for all the ordinary purposes that it can be expected to be used for.The owner of the property is generally entitled to an injunction against a person committing a wrongful act that interferes with their right to light.

You should always take legal advice if your business is negotiating a large or unusual contract. Does the person you are dealing with have the authority to negotiate and on whose behalf are they negotiating?If so, get the other party to sign a confidentiality agreement  starting negotiations. A confidentiality agreement (also known as a non-disclosure agreement or NDA) should be signed before giving away any business sensitive information. The agreement should explain that the information given: Is confidential.Should only be used for a stated purpose.Should not be shown to anyone else.Should be returned or destroyed if the deal does not go ahead.Take legal advice before handing over any business sensitive information. It can be unlawful to hand over certain types of information, such as personal data about customers or employees. A confidentiality agreement may give some protection, but it must be signed before anything is handed over. Consider whether the other party actually needs the information or whether they are simply on a fishing expedition.If you exaggerate or mislead the other party during negotiations, the contract may be dismissed and compensation payable.The Bribery Act 2010, scheduled to come into force in April 2011, has been introduced to strengthen the existing bribery and corruption laws in the UK. It creates a number of offences: Bribing another person.Being bribed.Bribing a foreign public official.Failing to prevent bribery. The penalties for committing an offence can be very significant. For example, the new corporate offence of failing to prevent bribery is punishable on indictment by an unlimited fine. If the other party has access to your customers or employees, consider getting them to sign a \"non-poaching agreement\". A non-poaching or non-solicitation agreement stops one party from approaching, for example, the employees, customers or clients of the other party. If you are negotiating a big or complex deal, you may be asked to sign a summary of the main terms before the main contract is agreed. This document can be called heads of terms, a term sheet or a memorandum of understanding.  You should take legal advice before signing any pre-contractual agreement. Even if the agreement is not meant to be legally binding, it may create legal obligations. In any event, it can create strong moral obligations which can weaken your negotiating position.A contract does not need to be signed and in writing to be binding. For example, you can enter into a binding contract over the phone or by e-mail provided the key terms are agreed. To help clarify that you are still in negotiations, you can mark all correspondence \"subject to contract\" or \"not legally binding\".

Relief under the scheme should not be factored into your business' end-of-year tax return. Instead a separate scheme return, showing relief claimed under the scheme, should be made at the same time as the end-of-year return.Your business should read HMRC's guidance carefully to ensure that you understand its scope and limitations properly. You should pay attention, in particular, to the anti-avoidance provisions, your record-keeping obligations, and the limitations and administrative requirements for the scheme to comply with EU State Aid rules.

When a company goes into administration, an insolvency practitioner takes over the control of the company's affairs from its directors.The main aim of administration is to rescue the company so that it can continue trading as a going concern. If this cannot be achieved, there are two other reasons why a company may go into administration:To achieve a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company was put into liquidation. To sell the company's property to make a distribution to the company's secured or preferential creditors. A secured creditor is, in general terms, entitled to be repaid from the proceeds of the secured assets. Preferential debts include certain employee claims and contributions to occupational pension schemes.In the majority of cases, the administration of a company leads to the sale of its assets. Administration may achieve a better result for the company's creditors than immediate liquidation, because, for example, the company may be able to continue trading allowing greater value to be achieved for its assets as part of a sale on a going concern basis. Pre-pack administration is the process in which the sale of the company's assets is agreed before the company goes into administration, and is then completed immediately after the start of the administration. The administration of a company must be completed within one calendar year unless the creditors or the court agrees to an extension. In practice, many companies remain in administration for more than one year and administrations can last several years.When the purposes of the administration have been achieved, the company may come out of administration and continue normal trading, although this is unusual in practice. More commonly, the net proceeds of the company's assets are distributed to the company's creditors, often by a subsequently appointed liquidator.When the net proceeds are distributed, creditors whose debts are not secured or preferential may receive a percentage of their debt by way of dividend. This may be as little as one or two pence in the pound, and can be nothing at all.The administrator must be a qualified insolvency practitioner. Often more than one administrator is appointed to act jointly. The administrator acts as an agent of the company and an officer of the court and therefore has a duty to act in good faith. They must also be, and be seen to be, independent and impartial in their management of the company and its property.Once appointed, the administrator must take all the company's property into their custody or control.As the company's agent, the administrator can cause the company to contract with third parties. Sums due under such contracts are paid in priority to the administrator's fees and expenses, and distributions to floating charge holders and unsecured creditors.Administrators have a duty to perform their functions as quickly and efficiently as possible and in the interests of the creditors as a whole. As soon as a company is placed in administration, creditors are prevented from bringing or pursuing legal proceedings against the company or its assets.It is possible to ask the administrator's or the court's permission to bring proceedings against a company that is in administration. However, a creditor who has a monetary claim is unlikely to be granted permission as it is generally only claims that relate to the ownership of property that are allowed to continue. If your company is owed money by a company that has gone into administration, often the best option is to submit details of your claim to the administrator (known as your proof of debt) and wait for the administrator to assess it. As a creditor, your company may be able to join a creditor's committee to help the administrator fulfil their functions. Administrators have a duty to report to the company's creditors on their progress. Becoming a member of the creditors' committee may provide you with an opportunity to access more detailed information and comment on the way the administrators are conducting the administration.When a company is in administration, although as a creditor you will be blocked from bringing an action against the company, time will continue to run for the limitation period of your claim. The limitation period for a simple contract claim is six years. Where time is running out, your company can protect its position by:Obtaining the administrator's acknowledgement of the claim. Note that this restarts the applicable limitation period and does not stop time running.Applying to the administrator of the court for permission to issue proceedings against the company. If your company has any concerns with the conduct of the administrator, you should initially raise any issues with the administrators themselves or via any creditors' committee. If the matter is not resolved adequately there are a number of legal remedies that you can consider.You can apply for a court order:On the basis that the administrator's conduct has unfairly harmed your interests, or the administrator is failing to perform their duties as quickly or efficiently as possible.On the basis of any wrongful exercise of legal authority by the administrator.To remove the administrator. This should only be used in extreme circumstances.The courts do not permit these remedies to be used by any one creditor to leapfrog claims of other creditors, nor to require the administrator to devote a disproportionate amount of time or resources to their particular claim."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "10/10/10 18:34", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/salary-sacrifice", "1.Init_Post": "A salary sacrifice arrangement involves an employee giving up part of their entitlement to salary which is subject to income tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs), in exchange for a new or enhanced non-cash benefit, which benefits from a full or partial exemption from tax and/or NICs. Two forms of employer-supported childcare benefit from exemption from tax and NICs:Childcare vouchers provided by the employer for qualifying childcare (the exemption covers the first \u00a355 a week, equivalent to \u00a3243 a month).Directly-contracted or employer-contracted childcare, where an employer arranges for the provision of qualifying childcare (again, the exemption covers the first \u00a355 a week).In addition, childcare facilities provided by an employer on site are usually entirely exempt from tax and NICs without limit.Provided the conditions for exemption are met, your employees will save tax and NICs on the salary sacrificed. For childcare vouchers, assuming the full amount is sacrificed, earners who pay tax at 40% will make a combined tax and NICs saving of \u00a31196 a year. Your business will be able to save up to \u00a3373 a year for each employee via reduced employer NICs.The voucher must be for childcare for a child (or stepchild or person under the parental responsibility) of the employee.The voucher can only be used to obtain qualifying childcare (this means the carer must have the appropriate registrations and approvals).The vouchers are available to all of the employer's employees.From 6 April 2011, new joiners will only be entitled to basic tax relief. However, higher and additional rate taxpayers who participate in such schemes will continue to enjoy higher or additional rate relief.The cycle to work scheme allows your business to loan cycles and cyclists' safety equipment to employees as a tax and NIC-free benefit. This means your employees will save tax and NICs on the salary sacrificed and your business will save employer's NICs.The cycle and/or the equipment are loaned to the employee. The exemption is  available if the agreement between your business and your employee provides for the automatic transfer of ownership of the bike to your employee at the end of the hire period.Your employee uses the cycle and/or the equipment mainly for qualifying journeys.The cycles and/or equipment are available generally to your employees. HMRC has confirmed that if there are employees who cannot participate in the scheme (because, for example, a salary sacrifice would take the employee below the national minimum wage), your business could make a pool of bikes available. As long as the pool of bikes was large enough, the condition would be satisfied.As your business will be lending the bike to your employee, a formal hire agreement is required. However, if the value of the bike and/or equipment is not more than \u00a31,000 (including VAT), you will not need a separate consumer credit licence as it will be covered by the group licence issued by the Office of Fair Trading.At the end of the hire period, your business can sell the bike and/or equipment to your employee. This will be a taxable supply for VAT purposes. If you sell the bike and/or equipment to your employee for less than market value, it will create a taxable benefit on which income tax and Class 1A NICs are payable.When an employee makes a pension contribution from salary actually paid, there is no NIC saving because employer and employee NICs are calculated on gross earnings. However, by replacing an entitlement to an amount of salary with an entitlement to an employer pension contribution, gross earnings are reduced, which reduces both employer and employee NICs. As there are no employer NICs on employer pension contributions, implementing a sacrifice scheme is an attractive way for your business to make NIC savings.At current rates, most employees will save NICs at only 1% by using the sacrifice route instead of by making an individual contribution to the pension scheme. However, your business' savings are likely to be much greater, currently 12.8%. Your business can pass on some or all of the saving by way of a higher special pension contribution. A fairly common arrangement is to share the NIC saving 50:50. The simplicity and cost efficiency for your employee of using a pension scheme already set up by the employer. In some schemes, the rules of the scheme limit the amount an employee can contribute. A salary sacrifice increases your business' contributions for a particular employee, not the employee's contributions. A salary sacrifice arrangement avoids the need for employees to set up their own pensions arrangements if they want to make contributions in excess of the scheme limits.The level of the working tax credit and child tax credit available to low or middle earnings employees may be increased by a salary sacrifice arrangement. However, your employees will need to be warned that state benefits can be reduced if the salary is sacrificed in return for certain employer benefits."}, {"2.Time_Posted": "10/10/10 18:31", "4.Discussion": [], "3.URL": "http://www.thelawforum.co.uk/brand-management", "1.Init_Post": "This checklist sets out the practical steps that will help your business protect, use and exploit any brands that it owns.A strong brand helps distinguish your products from your competitors'. It adds value to your business by enhancing consumer awareness and improving customer loyalty. A brand can be made up of many elements, including:A logo (Nike swish).A word (Kodak).A colour (Virgin red).A shape (Coca-Cola bottle).A strap line or jingle (The future's bright, the future's Orange).A domain name (Amazon.com).A person's name (David Beckham).A strong brand can be a very valuable commercial asset. According to a recent survey the top three global brands by value were:Coca-Cola (worth $68,734 million).IBM (worth $60,211 million).Microsoft (worth $56,647 million).Brands can also be lost or devalued if they are not adequately protected; they can even be destroyed by a single remark. Gerald Ratner, CEO of the jewellery group Ratners, famously described some of his own products as \"total crap\". An estimated \u00a3500 million was wiped off the value of the group and it eventually had to be completely re-branded as the Signet Group.Many elements of a brand can be protected as so-called intellectual property rights. These are legal rights that apply to creative work and, for example, prevent copying and unauthorised third party use. Make sure you take legal advice early on in the creative process. This will help ensure that whatever you create can be protected and does not infringe other people's brands or other rights. Take great care if you involve third parties, such as brand consultants or advertising agencies, in creating a brand. Make sure that they sign confidentiality agreements and transfer rights in their creative output (such as copyright) to your business. Carry out internet searches to check that the brand is not already being used by another business. Instruct a law firm to conduct further searches of the relevant registries if necessary. Keep accurate records of the development process and date stamp these documents. This will help you provide evidence if any infringement claim is brought against you. For example, evidence that it was created as part of an original process, rather than copied.Your business can use legal rights to protect your brand value:applies to original work such as creative or artistic output including a piece of writing, music, photograph, software or video clip. It provides automatic protection to original work against other people copying the work without permission.  arise through registration and/or use in a commercial context and can protect brand elements such as logos, slogans and colours.Some elements of a brand can get greater protection if they are registered (for example, as a registered trade mark). Applications to register these rights will be tested, among other things, on their merits and against existing third party rights. In the case of trade marks, this includes a consideration of whether the mark is distinctive. Registration gives you the exclusive right to use the trade mark as registered and enforce that right against anyone using it without your permission. Unregistered rights are similar but are harder to enforce and therefore protect. For example, for an unregistered trade mark, your business will have to prove that it has the goodwill in the mark, which can be very difficult and expensive to establish. Registration makes enforcement a lot easier but it may be costly and time-consuming. Your business will also need to consider whether to register on a national or cross-border basis (for example, across the European Union). The issues are complex so you should take legal advice beforehand. Once a brand has been created and protected, it is important that you use it consistently and do nothing that could cause you to lose protection:Draw up or review your existing brand guidelines. They should include clear rules on how the brand must be used throughout your business. Strictly enforce your brand guidelines internally and externally to build up the brand, its market presence and therefore its value. Even minor changes in the way your brand is used, for example, in font or colour, can create a new right that will need to be protected in addition to the rights you already have. Costs of protection, for example registration fees, can quickly mount up if you have lots of different variations of your brand. Use copyright notices \u00a9 and trade mark symbols (\u2122 for an unregistered trade mark and \u00ae for a registered trade mark) where appropriate. They act as an early warning system to would-be infringers and will help your business when seeking to prove that a defendant knew about your right.  Ensure that registered rights are used. Failure to do so can, in some cases, result in loss of protection. Ensure that any renewal fees for registered rights are paid on time, otherwise you risk losing the protection of the registration. Check that any brands licensed in from third parties, for example a registered trade mark, are being used in accordance with the terms of that licence.A brand can be commercially exploited in a number of ways. The main methods are by licence or assignment:is an agreement that gives another business the right to use your brand for a defined period in a defined territory. Once the term has ended, ownership and control of the brand returns to your business. is an agreement that sells your brand to another business. You lose control of it but receive a lump sum in return.Always take legal advice before allowing any third party to use your brand either formally or informally.A written agreement governing use of the brand should always be signed if you are considering entering into an agreement with a third party.  Put guidelines in place governing the use of your brand by others (for example, subsidiaries, franchisees and distributors) and strictly enforce these guidelines. Your business should monitor use and ensure adherence to your brand guidelines. Your business can request that a third party obtain your prior written approval for use of your brand.Your business can lose brand protection if you allow people to use your brand on an unauthorised basis, however minor. Misuse of your business' brand by others will also weaken its value. Your business must therefore monitor infringement and actively pursue infringers:Keep accurate records of permitted third party use of your brands. Monitor use to ensure adherence to the terms of any agreement. Have a system in place for reporting unauthorised use of your brand or use of similar marks or brands. Make sure everyone understands the importance of reporting any misuse of your business' brand, even if the use is for different goods or services to your own. Take legal advice immediately if your business becomes aware of any misuse of your brand. In many cases, time will be of the essence to prevent damage to your brand and consequential sales losses.Be very careful if you use another company's brand in any of your marketing. For example, your business should not use somebody else's logo on your website to make it look like they have endorsed your product. Your business can use a competitor's brands in your own adverts, subject to certain restrictions. For example, if you are comparing them with your own brand you must not insult or denigrate your rival's brand. Take legal advice if your business is considering using a rival brand in any of your advertising, particularly in view of the fact that the law has recently changed in this area.

There are laws and voluntary codes that govern most sales promotions, so you should take legal advice before holding any type of sales promotion. Failure to comply could result in your business having to withdraw the campaign, being fined, adverse publicity and possible criminal prosecution.Success in a competition must depend to a substantial degree on the exercise of skill. Participation can be made dependent on the payment of a contribution. The competition should not merely consist of guessing the outcome of a race, competition or other event, or guessing whether or not something will happen or is true, as these types of promotions can create legal problems.A prize draw is a scheme in which prizes are allocated by chance but there is no entry charge. In Great Britain, your business would be allowed to require a purchase as a condition of entry, but the price of the product cannot be inflated to cover the cost of the promotion, otherwise the draw will be deemed a lottery. The rules are different for draws carried out in Northern Ireland.With a few exceptions (for example, the National Lottery), running a lottery requires numerous licences and compliance with various laws.Your business can restrict entry to individuals who accept certain conditions (for example, giving personal information).If the draw is open to all, the chances of success must be the same for everyone regardless of how they entered and the prize allocation must be by chance.Participants in an \"instant win\" draw should be able to get their prize immediately or know they have won and how to claim their prize without delay, cost or hassle.Your business should not offer a prize promotion without awarding the prizes described or a reasonable equivalent.Do not create a false impression that a consumer has already won a prize if there is no prize or the customer has to incur a cost to claim the prize, as this is a criminal offence.A price promotion could be money off or free extra volume or value.The promotion must be a genuine price reduction or increase in volume that is applied for a particular period of time. Your business must say when the offer ends or that it is \"subject to availability\". You should ensure that you estimate demand for the offer as accurately as possible.The promotion must always be clear and not misleading. The comparison with the regular price or amount must be clearly marked and should not be ambiguous. For example, is the consumer getting 10% more volume or the same volume for 10% less cost?The goods must be the same quality and size as normally priced goods.If your business is comparing the price to your previous or usual price (including for volume promotions), then the previous price should have been the most recent price available for 28 consecutive days or more and comparisons should not be made with prices that were last offered more than six months ago. Your business can then reduce the sale price further if you wish, as long as you mention the interim price. Your business should not suggest the sale is for a shorter period of time than you intend. However, you can extend the sale period if you clearly announce it is an extension. Notices saying, for example, \"up to 50% off\" can only be used if the maximum reduction quoted applies to at least 10% of the range of products on offer.The offer must be limited in time and the product under promotion must be available after the promotion has ended at the same outlet but at the higher price. Remember that claiming an offer is limited when it is not is a criminal offence.\"Free\" products must be that: free. The offer is not free if your business has increased the price of any product the consumer must also buy or added other charges (beyond unavoidable cost, such as the true cost of freight).If you are issuing coupons to be redeemed against a particular product, ensure that retailers only accept the coupons against that product.Never describe a gift (that is, something offered to all or most participants) as a prize.Always ensure that you have a sponsorship agreement in place, however small the sponsorship deal. Any promotion or incentive offered to your employees must not conflict with the interests of your business or compromise the employee's ability to give honest advice to the consumer.

An insolvent individual can petition the court for their own bankruptcy. Alternatively, a creditor can issue a bankruptcy petition against an insolvent individual. After an individual is made bankrupt, a trustee in bankruptcy (either the Official Receiver or an insolvency practitioner) is appointed. The trustee in bankruptcy takes control of all the insolvent individual's assets. Their main duties are to sell these assets and share the money out among the creditors. The ability of a bankrupt individual to trade and take credit will be restricted during this period. An individual's bankruptcy usually lasts for one year, although it may take the trustee in bankruptcy longer to sell the assets and share the money among the creditors.An individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) is an agreement between an insolvent individual and their creditors that either compromises their debts, or creates a framework to settle them.  Any insolvent individual can propose an IVA to their creditors. If necessary, they can seek a court order to prevent their creditors taking action to recover the debts owed to them until they have voted on the IVA proposal. Creditors vote on the IVA proposal at a creditors' meeting. Each creditor receives one vote for each pound the debtor owes to it. If more than 75% of the votes cast at the meeting approve the IVA, it will come into effect. When an IVA comes into effect, it binds all unsecured creditors of the insolvent individual to its terms. An IVA binds creditors that did not attend or vote at the creditor's meeting and even creditors that voted against the proposal.  A number of firms exist to advise debtors on the options available to them to manage or compromise their debts. These firms can undertake most of the work of drafting an IVA proposal. The supervisor named in an IVA proposal will typically be employed by the firm that has advised on the IVA. An insolvency practitioner can charge for their work as a supervisor of an IVA. The Straightforward Consumer IVA Protocol contains standard terms for a typical IVA for consumer debts. It also gives guidance on: how a debtor should present their IVA;what constitutes an appropriate level of return to creditors; and how insolvency practitioners should calculate their fees in relation to such IVAs.  IVA proposals that follow the Protocol guidelines are referred to as \"Protocol-compliant\". The Protocol has the support of the British Bankers' Association and the professional bodies that regulate the conduct of insolvency practitioners. However, a recent High Court decision has held that the Protocol does not create any binding obligations and does not restrict a creditor's right to vote against an IVA proposal, even if the IVA proposal is fully compliant with the terms of the Protocol. This may lead to creditors seeking more modifications to proposals as the \"price\" of supporting an IVA. A debt relief order (DRO) will prevent creditors from enforcing their debts against an insolvent individual for a year, after which they will be discharged from liability for those debts.A debt management plan (DMP) is an informal, unregulated agreement between an individual and some or all of their creditors, under which they agree to repay what they owe (or an agreed lesser sum) over time.

The Environment Agency (EA) secured a total of \u00a3315,000 in fines, costs and a confiscation order, in connection with the illegal operation of a scrap metal yard. The EA found that the site had no sealed drainage system for the hazardous waste and liquids produced by the scrap vehicles, and that vehicle parts were not stored on a suitably impermeable surface. As such, it had the potential for significant environmental damage. The defendants (the company, its director and an officer) were found guilty of breaches of environmental regulations. The court issued the confiscation order for \u00a3275,000 on the grounds that the defendants' activities had undermined legitimate businesses.Understanding the regulator's approach to the enforcement and prosecution of environmental offences should enable your business to minimise the risk of being prosecuted. It will also help you to reduce the level of any penalties if you are prosecuted and minimise any damage to your business' reputation. There are a number of potential implications for your business if it is convicted of breaching environmental legislation:All environmental offences are subject to a fine. Many of the more serious environmental offences are also subject to a custodial sentence. Some environmental legislation sets a level of fine in excess of the statutory maximum, for example, up to  for some summary waste offences. Typically, environmental offences are subject to an  in the Crown Court.A court can order a custodial sentence for certain more serious environmental offences. New legislation has given regulators (including the EA and other environmental regulators, such as local authorities) the power to impose civil penalties on businesses, as an alternative to prosecuting. For more serious offences the court can make related orders, either at the same time as sentencing or in subsequent proceedings.The offender can be prohibited from acting as a company director. Breach of a directors disqualification order is a criminal offence.A prosecutor (usually the EA in environmental cases) can refer cases to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) after a conviction, asking SOCA to confiscate assets equal to the financial benefit gained from the criminal environmental activity.An anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) prohibits a person from acting in an anti-social manner that causes harm or distress to other members of the public. The power to award an ASBO can apply to environmental crimes.A serious crime prevention order (SCPO) can be made after a person has been convicted of a serious offence. A \"serious offence\" includes a number of environmental offences, for example, a breach of the prohibition on unauthorised or harmful deposit, treatment or disposal of waste. An SCPO can be made against an individual or a business and may last for up to five years.A conviction for an environmental offence may lead to adverse local and, in some cases, national publicity. The EA publicises environmental convictions on its website as part of its \"name and shame\" policy. Local press also often sit in on criminal court proceedings. There will inevitably be damage to your business' reputation, even if it is found \"not guilty\" at the end of the proceedings.A conviction could increase your business' insurance premiums.Your business' ongoing relationship with the regulator may be undermined.A poor environmental compliance record, particularly prosecutions and convictions, can cause difficulties if you decide to try and sell your business, especially if the buyer requests additional environmental warranties and indemnities.

Information that is written on the internet or in e-mails can seriously damage your business' reputation and the reputation of individual employees. Your employees could lose their job, be sued or imprisoned and your business could be sued or fined. Writing something on the internet or in an e-mail is exactly the same as writing it in a letter and, because of the lack of control of who might ultimately see it, sometimes worse. Remember, your business cannot control what the recipient does with an e-mail - they can be forwarded within seconds.Inappropriate information that is written online or in an e-mail can have severe financial repercussions for your business. It can also create serious personal and disciplinary issues for individual employees.Even if your employees are e-mailing or using other forms of online communication in their own time, if they refer to people at work or work-related matters, they could get themselves, and your business, in serious trouble.E-mails and internet postings can be used against your business in legal proceedings or other regulatory investigations. Your business should never delete e-mails relating to a legal dispute or investigation or a potential dispute or investigation.Simply deleting e-mails or internet postings will not necessarily solve the problem \u2013 forensic IT equipment can still find supposedly \"deleted\" messages.Online content or e-mails that could be thought of as obscene, racist, sexist, bullying or hurtful should never be posted or sent. Anti-discrimination laws can hold your business \"vicariously\" liable for discrimination by your employees. If a comment is made about another employee online that amounts to harassment, your business could be liable, even if the employee was using their own equipment to post the comment. Exaggerating or making false or inaccurate statements about another company or person could lead to your business being sued, even if the e-mail was only sent to one person.Forwarding an e-mail can be just as serious as writing the original \u2013 the individual that sent the original e-mail could be sued, even if it was sent or forwarded to only one person.Where possible, avoid sending confidential information by e-mail. Your business should take legal advice on how the information can be best protected. Any e-mail containing confidential information should be clearly marked as \"confidential\".If your business receives an e-mail that contains \"dangerous\" material (for example, another company's trade secrets), you should take legal advice.A legally binding contract can be made by a simple exchange of e-mails.Your business should make it clear that it does not intend to be bound by what is communicated in an e-mail.Your business should not use other people's work in e-mails or online posts unless you have permission from the original author, or you know that it is not protected by copyright. This includes photographs and music.Encourage your employees to carefully monitor what arrives in their inbox, especially if they do not recognise the sender, or the title of the e-mail seems peculiar.If there is any risk that an e-mail may contain a virus, it should not be opened and your IT department should be contacted immediately.Make your employees aware that they may be disciplined or even dismissed for forwarding inappropriate e-mails or accessing inappropriate websites at work \u2013 in severe cases it could also be a criminal offence.Most businesses allow light personal internet and e-mail usage as long as it does not interfere with their employees' duties. However, you should make your employees aware that excessive, unproductive usage of the internet and e-mails at work may be treated as gross misconduct for which they could be dismissed.E-mails can often be a waste of time.

The reasons why dividend prospects are low are as follows: 1. Often the directors of the company have chosen to avoid the issues of the failing business, resulting in a creditor becoming frustrated and they issue a winding up petition. 2. The result is the assets of the business have seriously been depleted by the time the court order is made, leaving few recoverable assets to collect in. 3. The costs of collecting in the assets are often high, whether they are physical machinery or product or book debts; what remains is what could not be sold or collected quickly when the company was trading in its last weeks and months. This leaves old cumbersome obsolete machinery, old stock and disputed book debts for the liquidator to collect. Amounts recovered are low and more effort and legal costs have to be spent to realise them. 4. In addition because following the Court Order the Official Receiver (a civil servant) is appointed to investigate the affairs of the company, there are those costs to be drawn from the assets realised. Often the Official Receiver remains as the liquidator if there is no prospects of recoverable assets. If the Official Receiver (OR) decides there are recoverable assets either the next independent Insolvency Practitioner (IP) is appointed from the OR\u2019s Rota for that region or a creditors meeting is called for creditors to choose an IP to appoint as liquidator. I would ask creditors to vote at a meeting, this can be done by post or fax, it is your opportunity to influence the proceedings. 5. From the assets recovered the monies is apportioned in an order of priority; - the OR\u2019s costs first,  - followed by an effective government tax called the Secretary of State Fee (charged on a percentage of realisations),  - then others costs such as the petitioning creditors costs,  - the liquidator\u2019s legal costs, fees and expenses, (note that the creditors meeting can set how and on what basis fees are calculated) - followed by the secured and preferential creditor (latter being part of employee claims),  - all these before the unsecured creditors (including HM Revenue & Customs) see a dividend. All unsecured creditors have to be treated the same whether they are owed \u00a31 or \u00a31million. 6. The actions of the directors and the transactions the company has entered into are reviewed. Legal action may be undertaken with the aim to recover substantial claims for the liquidation from actions against the directors or overturning a transaction. However if funds are limited but the evidence is compelling a solicitor will sometimes take on the legal action for the liquidator but on a conditional fee agreement which if won the solicitor will charge at least double the fee, if however the case is lost then the solicitor takes the risk of not being paid. 7. As stated by Ian, creditors can influence the decisions taken in a liquidation case. A liquidator often relies on evidence presented by creditors to recover assets or take on legal actions for the benefit of all creditors. The possible solutions of avoiding being a compulsory liquidation creditor: a) Operate a tight credit control system and stick to it, even if your customer is your best friend, don\u2019t extend further credit. b) The sooner a customer shows signs of financial stress, i.e. not paying the bill for the second time, so falling more into arrears, don\u2019t be British and say nothing, ask them if they are experiencing difficulties. Talk to the customer.  c) Take recover action before another customer does. Business owners will pay whoever is shouting the loudest. Ultimately it can become an unrecoverable situation when a business pays the first to take action as available cash is depleated, when informal and formal options are available. d) Business owners often make promises that are unrealistic; ask for an analysis of the business finances or some evidence to back up the promises.  e) A personal guarantee from a director may result in a recovery of monies for you as the customer. If possible have security over assets of the director. If an insolvent business pays you in preference to other creditors then rules have been broken and a liquidator could ask for the money back.  f) The biggest obstacle a business owner has is admitting there is a problem. If you have a customer who is falling into arrears with payments take some advice on the options. g) If the problem is short-term there are charitable organisations which operate business advice helplines to structure informal payment agreements with creditors. My advice however is that all creditors should be treated equally not just one or two where arrears have built up. h) However if your customer\u2019s financial situation is more serious, then that customer should be seeking professional advice. Bottomley & Co like some other licensed firms offers a free consultation to discuss available options. Taking advice early means that if a formal insolvency is appropriate it could one of the following: - Administration \u2013 a rescue procedure, a creditor can now petition for the Administration of a company. Administration appoints an IP to sell the business or the assets in such a way that it provides a better result than a Liquidation - Company Voluntary Arrangement \u2013 a recovery plan - Creditors Voluntary Arrangement \u2013 a liquidation but without the specific costs of a Compulsory Liquidation It is then more likely that assets can be realised in an orderly manner with a potential greater benefit to creditors. We as a firm are regularly paying dividends to creditors. i) As stated earlier the IP in whatever insolvency role relies on information from creditors. As a firm we appreciate that creditors have a business to continue after suffering a bad debt however we all too often have promises of support at a creditors meeting but when we ask for witness statements or evidence from creditors we don\u2019t get it. This can result in the IP not taking a legal action due to lack of evidence.  We appreciate the rewards of a future dividend distribution from an insolvency case may be speculative but in this financial climate something is better than nothing. We have a duty to recover monies for creditors, yes we too are in business, but we have a statutory duty to carry out tasks often without getting paid for it, my request is work with us so that we can recover more for all creditors.

In any case the OR has the role of reporting on the director\u2019s conduct in all compulsory liquidations. The OR takes a decision whether a criminal fraudulent trading action is undertaken. However if an IP is appointed it is he or she that often supplies much of the evidence to the OR.  If a creditor or group of creditors want an IP to deal with the case then they can ask the OR to call a creditors meeting if they amount to a significant percentage (25%) of the creditors. If creditors then agree on an IP being appointed he or she will have to assess the case prospects before accepting the appointment. This will be based on what information is available prior to the creditors meeting (which may not be very much!) to determine the economics of taking recovery action and the prospects of realising money to pay all the liquidation costs in the order of priority set out in my previous post. The IP then also calls a creditors meeting to seek the basis of how time spent on the case will be paid. The IP takes a risk that if there is a speculative legal action to recover monies into the liquidation, and the case is lost, then the time spent may be written off. The IP may ask for creditors to support financially the costs of the liquidation including IP\u2019s fees. However creditors like Bottomley & Co have to assess the risks of not getting a return back on the effort put into a case.  If the director has acted improperly but not fraudulently this is a wrongful trading, an action which is a civil matter, it is relatively easier to prove.

A court order is required to put a company into compulsory liquidation. At the end of the liquidation, the company is dissolved. The most common reason for a winding up order is that the company is insolvent.In an administration or liquidation, all unsecured creditors, must share equally any available assets of the company, or any proceeds from the sale of any of those assets, in proportion to the debts due to each creditor. As an unsecured creditor, your business may receive a dividend paid in proportion to the debts owed to you at the end of the liquidation and possibly an interim dividend. An interim dividend is a dividend that is declared and distributed before the company's annual earnings have been calculated. In some cases, the dividend to unsecured creditors will be just a few pence in the pound, and it may be nothing at all. If your business has the benefit of security, you are entitled to be paid from the proceeds of sale of the secured assets, subject to certain exceptions.The liquidator is an officer of the court and therefore has a duty to act fairly and impartially. As a creditor, your business will be invited to provide the liquidator with details of your claim (this is known as your ). The liquidator will then assess all the proofs of debt. Your claim may be accepted in whole or part or be rejected. There is an automatic stay of legal proceedings against the company or its assets. If your business decides to bring or pursue legal proceedings against the company, you must first apply to court for permission. If your claim is for money only, you are unlikely to be granted permission. Generally, only claims connected to property are allowed to continue.Your business is entitled to receive reports on the progress of the liquidation from the liquidator. You may also form a liquidation committee with at least two other creditors, to help the liquidator fulfil his functions.Your business could challenge:the level of the liquidator's remuneration. the liquidator's decision in relation to any proof of debt. In extreme cases, and where it is in the interests of the liquidation, a liquidator may be removed by a court order or a meeting of the company's creditors.

Basic rate taxpayers will continue to be liable at 18%. The new rate will apply equally to any deferred gains that come into charge on or after 23 June 2010.To a limited extent, a planning opportunity exists for the directors of owner-managed companies, who are able to control the amount of income that they receive in a given year. If such directors are planning to realise capital gains (for example, on the sale of a second home or an investment portfolio), they may be able to reduce their income levels for the year of the disposal in order to pay CGT at the lower rate.With effect from 23 June 2010, the lifetime limit for entrepreneurs' relief rises from \u00a32 million to \u00a35 million. This means that a tax rate of 10% will apply to the first \u00a35 million of qualifying gains. The increased lifetime limit will apply in relation to disposals on or after 23 June 2010. To the extent that any gains realised by the taxpayer before that date exceed the old \u00a32 million lifetime limit of entrepreneurs' relief, CGT will remain payable at the full rate of 18% on the excess, but only the \u00a32 million of relief claimed will be set against the increased limit for future qualifying disposals.The standard rate of VAT will increase (from 17.5%) to 20% with effect from 4 January 2011. The 20% rate will apply to supplies made on or after 4 January 2011 and acquisitions or importations taking place on or after that date. This measure does not affect supplies subject to other rates of VAT, such as the zero-rate or reduced rate.The government announced a \"roadmap for corporate tax reform\", with further details to follow in the autumn. The reform will be based on the government's view that a broad tax base, a low corporate tax rate and a more territorial approach will make the UK's tax system more competitive. The Budget Report states that \"the manufacturing sector as a whole will pay less corporation tax as a result\" of the government's reforms. From 1 April 2012 (for corporation tax) or 6 April 2012 (for income tax), the annual rate of writing down allowances for both new and unrelieved expenditure on plant and machinery will be reduced to 18% (from 20%) and the annual rate for special rate pool expenditure will be reduced to 8% (from 10%). In addition, also from 2012, the maximum annual investment allowance will be reduced to \u00a325,000 (from \u00a3100,000).The government has announced that it \"remains committed\" to a review of IR35 and small business tax, and that it will release further details \"shortly\".There will be a 100% first year allowance, subject to certain conditions, for the purchase of new and unused (not second-hand) zero-emission goods vehicles has been introduced. The allowance will have effect for a five-year period beginning on 1 April 2010 for companies (6 April for unincorporated businesses) until 31 March 2015 (5 April 2015 for non-corporates).The June 2010 Budget confirmed that a previously announced change to enterprise management incentives (EMI) legislation will go ahead. The change will enable companies with a permanent establishment in the UK to grant EMI options (currently, only companies which carry out a qualifying trade wholly or mainly in the UK can grant EMI options).The June 2010 Budget Report included the following announcements regarding PAYE and income tax measures:A commitment to explore ways of improving the PAYE system, starting with a consultation with employers and payroll providers on ways of capturing more frequent or even real-time PAYE data. A consultation on introducing powers for HMRC to require financial security where PAYE and NICs are at serious risk of non-payment. The consultation will also consider the proposed criminal penalty for failure to provide a financial security.Legislation to restrict tax breaks for workplace canteens will take effect from April 2011. Confirmation of changes to employer-supported childcare such as nursery vouchers, including the restriction of the tax benefits for higher and additional rate taxpayers, which will take effect for new joiners to a scheme on or after 6 April 2011.Employer NIC contributions will increase (from 12.8% to 13.8%) from 6 April 2011. The secondary (employers') threshold will be increased by \u00a321 above the Retail Price Index, also from 6 April 2011. At the same time, the upper earnings limit will be reduced to align it with the higher rate threshold. The government will shortly announce details of a scheme to promote the creation of new businesses in those parts of the UK that are most reliant on public sector employment. Those areas are Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber, the North West, the East Midlands, the West Midlands and the South West. During a three-year period, new businesses in these areas will be exempt from the first \u00a35,000 of Class 1 employer NICs due in the first twelve months of employment. This will apply for the first ten employees hired in the first year of business. Subject to meeting the necessary legal requirements, the scheme is intended to start from 6 September 2010 but this has yet to be confirmed. Most kinds of business (including property and investment businesses) will be eligible for the scheme.The government has announced that legislation will be introduced to abolish one of the conditions that a SME must satisfy in order to claim the enhanced tax relief for research and development (R&D) expenditure. Companies that are SMEs may claim an enhanced tax relief at the rate of 175% for qualifying expenditure on R&D. One of the conditions that a SME company must satisfy in order to claim this relief is that the company owns any intellectual property (IP) deriving from the R&D to which the expenditure is attributable. The government has announced that this condition will be abolished. The change will have effect for any expenditure incurred by a SME company on R&D in an accounting period ending on or after 9 December 2009.The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) can be a valuable source of capital for SMEs: investors are entitled to tax reliefs, provided a number of conditions relating to the investee company are satisfied. The government announced in the Budget that EIS relief will not be available for investments in businesses that are in financial difficulty. This change will take effect from a date to be announced, irrespective of when the money was raised under the EIS investment. This means that the existing investments may be affected. The same change will also apply to investments by Venture Capital Trusts.

Basic rate taxpayers will continue to be liable at 18%. The new rate will apply equally to any deferred gains that come into charge on or after 23 June 2010. The annual exempt amount will remain at \u00a310,100 for the tax year 2010-11.The inheritance tax (IHT) nil rate band will remain frozen at \u00a3325,000 until 5 April 2015.The 50% additional income tax rate will remain in place for the time being. The rate took effect on 6 April 2010 and applies to income over \u00a3150,000.The government announced that it will not proceed with the proposal to withdraw the furnished holiday lettings (FHL) rules. The existing rules will continue to apply to holiday lettings situated in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area during the tax year 2010-11.The existing annuitisation rules, effectively requiring members of registered pension schemes to buy an annuity by age 75 will be abolished from 2011/12. In the meantime, the requirement will be deferred for any members who reach age 75 on or after 22 June 2010, they will not have to buy an annuity until they reach age 77. A new SDLT rate of 5% for purchases of residential property where the consideration exceeds \u00a31 million, will take effect on 6 April 2011. The previous highest rate was 4% for purchases where the consideration exceeds \u00a3500,000. All other SDLT rates and thresholds remain unchanged.In the March 2010 Budget, the former Labour government announced the introduction of SDLT relief for first-time buyers of residential property where the consideration does not exceed \u00a3250,000. In the June 2010 Budget, the new government said that it will review first-time buyer relief taking into account its impact on affordability and value for money. The existing nil rate of SDLT on residential purchases not exceeding \u00a3125,000 continues to apply as before (which means that it is not limited to first-time buyers).Limits on tax-free investment in individual savings accounts (ISAs) will increase in line with the retail prices index (RPI) from 6 April 2011. If the RPI is negative, the limits will remain unchanged.With effect from 23 June 2010, the lifetime limit for entrepreneurs' relief will rise from \u00a32 million to \u00a35 million. Currently, entrepreneurs' relief achieves an effective rate of tax of 10% on the first \u00a32 million of qualifying gain by reducing the gain by 4/9 and taxing the balance at 18%. However, as a consequence of the introduction of the 28% rate of CGT, the method of giving the relief will be reformulated so that a tax rate of 10% will apply to the first \u00a35 million of qualifying gain. The increased limit will apply in relation to disposals on or after 23 June 2010. To the extent that any gains realised by the taxpayer before that date exceed the current \u00a32 million lifetime limit of entrepreneurs' relief, CGT will remain payable at the full rate of 18% on the excess, but only the \u00a32 million of relief claimed will be set against the increased limit for future qualifying disposals.The rules for principal private residence relief (PPR) from CGT will be amended to ensure that the relief is preserved where a carer provides accommodation to a vulnerable adult under an Adult Placement Carers (APC) scheme. PPR provides relief from CGT when an individual disposes of his dwelling house (or an interest in a dwelling house) that has been his only or main residence at some point during his ownership. PPR is not available on any part of a dwelling house that is used exclusively for the purposes of a trade, business, profession or vocation. The proposed amendment will ensure that occupation of part of the carer's house by an adult in care will not restrict the relief.Legislation will be introduced to establish a new income tax relief for shared lives carers (that is, those who share their homes and family life with individuals, including adults, placed with them under the shared lives scheme). The relief, which will be known as \"qualifying care relief\", will be introduced as soon as possible after the summer recess. It will allow shared lives carers to claim a tax free allowance and will be available from 2010-11.With effect from 6 April 2011, the personal allowance for those aged under 65 will increase by \u00a31,000 to \u00a37,475. However, legislation will be introduced to ensure that higher rate taxpayers do not benefit from the increase. This will be achieved by lowering the threshold above which higher rate tax is paid. The exact figure will be announced in the autumn, as it will depend on the movement of the RPI in the year to September. The government has also confirmed that the higher rate lower threshold will be frozen in 2012-13.For NICs, the increase of \u00a3570 in the primary (employee) threshold, which was announced in the March 2010 Budget, will take effect from 6 April 2011 to coincide with the increase of 1% in employee contributions (from 11% to 12%).

This means that workers on long-term sick leave can take holiday and be paid for it, even where they have exhausted their right to statutory and/or contractual sick pay.In a recent case, an employment tribunal decided that a worker who had been on sick leave for the last 15 months of his employment was entitled to statutory holiday pay for that period. The non-payment of holiday pay was regarded as an unlawful deduction from wages, even though the worker had not actually taken statutory holiday during the period in question.Workers on long-term sick leave do not necessarily need to wait until the termination of their employment to request holiday pay. If you are notified that they wish to take statutory holiday on certain dates (and you do not refuse the request), your business will be obliged to make holiday payments at that time.If one of your workers gives notice that they want to take statutory holiday on particular days, you can give a counter-notice which enables you to prevent them taking holiday on the requested dates. However, there is little point in you doing this if your worker is unlikely to return to work in the current leave year. You will almost certainly be in breach of the legislation if you issue a counter-notice to prevent your worker from taking their holiday before the leave year ends. Your business may then be liable to pay compensation for a refusal to allow holiday to be taken. You may also be liable to pay holiday pay for the untaken holiday period when your worker's employment eventually ends. Issuing a counter-notice could theoretically save your business money in some circumstances. For example:One of your workers is on long-term sick leave and their contractual sick pay is due to run out in two months' time. There are four months of the leave year remaining.Your worker asks to take a period of paid statutory holiday that starts immediately after their contractual sick pay expires. If you do not refuse the request, your worker would continue to be paid beyond the contractual sick pay period. Your worker's illness is improving, and there is a good chance that they will return to work before the end of the leave year.In these circumstances, you might decide to give a counter-notice rejecting your worker's holiday request. Your worker would not be paid if they remain on sick leave after their contractual sick pay expires. Your worker will have the opportunity to take the paid holiday on their return to work, before the end of the leave year.If your business takes this action it could save a number of weeks' pay. You could also argue that your business is adhering to the legislation as you would be ensuring that your worker enjoyed a \"proper\" period of holiday from work rather than a \"theoretical\" holiday period when they would have been absent in any event because of sickness.However, there are a number of reasons why it might not be sensible to issue a counter-notice, which in most cases should discourage you from doing so:Your business may not gain much from refusing the request. You could pay your worker less when they are off, but you would then lose their services for a period of paid holiday after they return to work. Your worker could then take holiday at a time when you might want to focus on reintegrating them into the workplace. Your worker might make a claim for . This would be on the basis that you breached the implied contractual term of mutual trust and confidence by rejecting their holiday request merely to save money. Your worker could arguably bring a . You could put in place a general policy of not allowing holiday to be taken during long-term sick leave other than in the last few weeks of the year. This would at least mean that individual workers would not feel singled out.Legislation enables your business to give notice to a worker specifying the dates on which statutory holiday must be taken. Therefore, you could give notice to a worker on long-term sick leave to use up their holiday entitlement before their contractual sick pay runs out. If so, your business might be able to avoid making holiday payments later in the year when your worker's contractual sick pay has been exhausted. However, if the worker objects you should not force them to take statutory holiday during sick leave against their wishes. This is likely to be in breach of the legislation, as case law suggests that if workers do not wish to take holiday during sick leave the holiday must be granted at a different time.A sick worker forced to take holiday at a time when other workers are not forced to do so might feel that your actions amount to a fundamental breach of contract, leading to a claim for  and possibly .

A number of changes to the Regulations will come into force on 1 October 2010.Property owners and landowners will need to be aware of the changes as the costs of constructing a new building will increase because of the need to meet greater energy efficiency requirements and reduce carbon emissions. Any cost increases are also likely to impact on potential purchasers (when they buy a new home) and on occupiers (who undertake work in their home). However, it is estimated that these additional costs will be offset by lower fuel bills over the life of the property. New requirements and guidance will be introduced for the installation and commissioning of fixed mechanical ventilation systems. For example:Ventilation requirements will be increased in certain situations to take account of increasingly airtight homes. Building owners will need to be provided with sufficient information to operate a building's ventilation system adequately. Builders will be required to notify the relevant local authority building control body (BCB): when a mechanical ventilation system is commissioned; and  of the measured air flow rate of a mechanical ventilation system in a new dwelling.The changes are designed to ensure that combustion appliances function safely in today's more airtight homes. They will:Introduce new requirements aimed at reducing the threat of carbon monoxide poisoning (for example, by installing carbon monoxide alarms in dwellings with new solid-fuel appliances). Provide guidance on improving ventilation in \"very airtight houses\", especially those where energy efficiency improvements mean that previous escape routes for carbon monoxide (such as draughty windows in old houses) have been eliminated.New requirements will be introduced with the aim of improving the energy efficiency of new homes by 25%. The amendments will:Adjust how the target emission rate (TER) is calculated.  Introduce a requirement to provide the BCB with a TER and dwelling emission rate (DER) before work starts. After completion, the builder will need to notify the BCB of the TER and DER actually achieved. Also, if the work was not carried out to specification, then the builder will have to confirm how the specification changed. Add margins of error to calculations where actual energy efficiency figures are estimated or extrapolated from existing data. In effect, this will encourage a detailed energy assessment of every building.If building work is undertaken that contravenes the Regulations, the BCB can:Serve an  which requires the removal or alteration of work that does not comply with the Regulations. The enforcement notice will give 28 days to carry out the required work, failing which the local authority can carry out the work at the cost of the owner/occupier. Apply for an  for the removal or alteration the work. Traditionally, injunctions have not been widely used to enforce the Regulations because of the costs involved. Injunctions tend to be used for those situations that are urgent and where the cost can be justified by the risk of serious danger to health and safety (for example, where a nightclub is at risk of fire). Prosecute a contravention of the Regulations through summary proceedings in the magistrates' court. Businesses may be liable to a  and an additional \u00a350 per day for each day the contravention continues after conviction. However, prosecutions are relatively infrequent and generally taken only for flagrant or wilful breaches.Even if a local authority does not prosecute or take enforcement action, it will not issue a completion certificate to confirm compliance with the Regulations if there has been a contravention. This may subsequently create difficulties when selling the property. A regularisation certificate can be obtained which provides evidence (but not conclusive evidence) that the requirements of the Regulations specified in the certificate have been complied with.

It also provides some practical steps for your business to take before the Act comes into force.Transparency International (a non-governmental anti-corruption organisation) defines bribery as \"the offering, promising, giving, accepting or soliciting of an advantage as an inducement for an action which is illegal or a breach of trust.\"The Bribery Act 2010 was introduced to strengthen the existing bribery and corruption laws in the UK. The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has repeatedly criticised the UK system for being weak and ineffective compared with the more robust regimes in other countries, such as the US Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act. A person will be guilty of this offence if they offer, promise or give a financial advantage or other advantage, to another person to bring about improper performance of a relevant function or an activity, or to reward a person for the improper performance of a relevant function or an activity.The types of function or activity that can be improperly performed include:all functions of a public nature;all activities connected with a business;any activity performed in the course of a person's employment; and any activity performed by or on behalf of a body of persons.where the person performing the function is expected to perform it in good faith or impartially or is in a position of trust by virtue of performing it. The function will be covered even if it has no connection with the UK or is performed outside the UK.It may not matter whether the person offered the bribe is the same person that will actually perform, or has performed, the function or activity concerned.The advantage can be offered, promised or given by the person themselves or by a third party.The recipient, or potential recipient of the bribe, will be guilty of this offence if they request, agree to receive, or accept a financial or other advantage to perform a relevant function or activity improperly. It does not matter whether it is the recipient, or someone else through whom the recipient acts, who requests, agrees to receive or accepts the advantage. In addition, the advantage can be for the benefit of the recipient or another person.A person will be guilty of this offence if they intend to influence an official in their capacity as a foreign public official. The offence does not cover accepting bribes, only offering, promising or giving bribes. It does not matter whether the offer, promise or gift is made directly to the official or via a third party.A commercial organisation will be guilty of this offence if a person associated with it bribes another person, with the intention of obtaining or retaining business or a business advantage for the commercial organisation. The offence can be committed in the UK or overseas.A business will be able to avoid conviction if it can demonstrate that it had adequate procedures in place designed to prevent bribery. The government has indicated that it will issue guidance on what \"adequate procedures\" are before the new law comes into effect.The offences of bribing another person, being bribed and bribing a foreign public official are punishable on indictment either by an ,. The new corporate offence of failure to prevent bribery is punishable on indictment by an .Businesses that have been convicted of corruption could find themselves  from tendering for public-sector contracts. Your business may also be damaged by  if it is prosecuted for an offence.Small and medium-sized enterprises will inevitably have fewer resources to counter bribery than larger companies. However, you can take some straight-forward measures before the law comes into force to help prevent your business falling foul of the new legislation.Make sure that all senior managers and directors understand that they could be personally liable under the Bribery Act 2010 for offences committed by the business. It is important that senior management lead the anti-bribery culture of your business, especially if it wants to take advantage of the \"adequate procedures\" defence to the offence of failing to prevent bribery. Make sure you understand the risks that your business may be exposed to. For example, certain industry sectors (such as construction, energy, oil and gas, defence and aerospace, mining and financial services) and countries present a greater risk as employees are more likely to engage in bribery in these areas. Think about the types of transactions that your business engages in; who the transactions are with and how you undertake the transaction. High-risk transactions include:procurement and supply chain management;involvement with regulatory relationships (for example, licences or permits); andcharitable and political contributions.Review how you entertain potential customers, especially those from government agencies or state-owned enterprises or charitable organisations. Routine or inexpensive corporate hospitality is unlikely to be a problem, but you need to have clear guidelines in place that everybody within your business understands.If your business operates in foreign jurisdictions, always check local laws. Your business will be liable if a person associated with it commits an offence on your behalf. You should review all your relationships with any partners, suppliers and customers. For example, if an agent or distributor uses a bribe to win a contract for your business, you could be liable. You must ensure that background checks are carried out on any agents or distributors before you engage them. Review any existing policies and procedures that your business has on preventing bribery and corruption and decide whether they need to be updated. If you do not have any policies or procedures in place, prepare them as a matter of urgency. Transparency International has written a guide aimed at small businesses for countering bribery, which includes model corporate anti-bribery policies and programmes: . If your business operates in a high-risk industry sector or country, you should consider introducing a compulsory training programme for all staff. If only a few of your employees operate in a high-risk area make sure the training is targeted at them.

It also provides some practical steps for businesses to take before the Act comes into force in October 2010. The Equality Act 2010 was introduced to harmonise discrimination law and to strengthen it. It brings together nine existing major pieces of discrimination legislation into a single act and creates a number of new rights and remedies to protect employees from discrimination.Discrimination laws cover all areas of employment including job adverts, job interviews, conduct during employment, social events at work, dismissal and giving job references. A business must not discriminate against or harass employees on the basis of: age; disability; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or belief; sex or sexual orientation. Pre-employment health enquiries will be prohibited except in limited circumstances (for example, establishing whether the applicant will be able to \"carry out a function that is intrinsic to the work concerned\"). The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will have the power to investigate the use of prohibited questions and take enforcement action. Simply asking pre-employment health questions will not amount to discrimination against an applicant, but acting on the answers may well do. If an unsuccessful job applicant brings a direct disability discrimination claim against your business, and a pre-employment health question was asked for a non-prescribed reason, the onus will be you to show that no discrimination took place.Secrecy clauses require employees to keep details of their pay secret and prevent them discussing their pay with their colleagues. Although secrecy clauses will not be banned, they will be unenforceable against employees who make or request a \"relevant pay disclosure\". The disclosure must be made with the possibility of pay discrimination in mind. For example, a female employee thinks she is underpaid compared with a male colleague. She therefore asks him what he is paid, and he tells her. Victimising an employee because they make, seek or receive a \"relevant pay disclosure\" will be unlawful.Harassment occurs when an individual engages in unwanted conduct that has the purpose or effect of violating another individual's dignity or creates a hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that individual. Businesses will be made liable, in some circumstances, for the harassment of an employee by a third party in the workplace (for example, where a restaurant failed to take reasonable steps to prevent a waitress being harassed by customers, despite knowing that the same type of harassment had occurred at least twice before).The definition of harassment will be widened to include harassment based on perception or association (for example, a person who is harassed because they are wrongly perceived to be gay, would have a claim).Positive action is currently limited to \"training and encouragement\" for under-represented groups. Its scope will be broadened to allow businesses to provide more help to encourage under-represented groups to apply for jobs (for example, by providing free English language lessons to non-English-speaking employees). In addition, businesses will be permitted (but not required) to take under-representation of particular groups into account when selecting between two job applicants who are \"as qualified as\" each other. However, neither automatic selection of under-represented groups nor quotas will be allowed.Employment tribunals will have the power to make recommendations that benefit the wider workforce, not just the claimant, in a successful discrimination claim. A tribunal will be able to recommend the steps that a business should take to reduce the adverse affect of discrimination in the workplace. For example, that the business:Introduces an equal opportunities policy.Ensures its harassment policy is more effectively implemented.Makes public the selection criteria for staff transfers or promotion.Although recommendations will not be binding, the failure by a business to comply with a recommendation could be used as evidence to support subsequent similar discrimination claims.Review any existing policies and procedures that your business has on discrimination and harassment and decide whether they should be updated.Make sure that all directors and managers within your business are aware of the changes.

The training or study applied for must be for the purpose of improving your employee's effectiveness at work and also improve the performance of your business.  It does not have to lead to a formal qualification (for example, it could simply be training on a new piece of software or equipment). The right will not apply to agency workers, school-age children or young employees who qualify for a separate right to time off for training.An employee may only make one application for time off for training in any 12-month period. Their application must be in writing and include details of the training they want to undertake. You must consider all requests seriously.The procedure that you must follow once you receive a request closely mirrors the procedure for dealing with a flexible working request:You must hold a meeting with the employee to discuss their application within 28 days of receiving it. You must give your employee a written, dated notice of your decision within 14 days of the meeting.

You will also be able to turn down requests where you do not believe that the training your employee has requested will help you improve the performance of your business.An employee has the right to appeal your decision. The appeal must be in writing, set out the grounds on which they wish to appeal and be submitted within 14 days of your initial decision. You have 14 days to either uphold the appeal and notify your employee or hold a further meeting with them to discuss the appeal.You may grant all, part of or none of the time off that is requested by your employee.
